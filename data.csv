Today was a bit tiring. I had some trouble falling asleep last night. I was worried mostly about keeping up with classes because I'm going away this weekend. I think next week will be better.
"Today started off poorly, but it ended really well. I am satisfied with my productivity this evening. Stressed about the quiz tomorrow though."
Today went well... I did alright on my Quiz. I'm excited to go to camp this weekend.
Today was tiring. I got back from the retreat and I enjoyed it. Grateful for knowing the connections I made and for my spiritual growth.
Today was overall productive. I'm still struggling to find time to fit in exercise. I need to start tomorrow and get my mental state ready for the rest of the week.
Today was tiring. I need to catch up on my studies. I hope tomorrow goes smoothly.
"Very tired, lots to do. Midterms are coming up. Hope it goes well."
Grateful for a good and productive Day. Hope the quiz tomorrow goes well.
Down about failing my quiz. Hope I can bounce back next time.
Today went well. Wasn't as productive as I wanted to be. Buses were too unreliable today.
"Today went good. Some lab marks were not as good, but it went good mostly."
I enjoyed spending time with my friends today. Studying with them is very encouraging. Hope the exam goes well tomorrow.
Feel confident after my Psych exam. I think it went well.
Too exhausting a day.
Today was a bit stressful. I was sick the past weekend and had a hard time. But I'm feeling better now.
"Today went good, I was very productive. Thankful for being able to get to this point in my studies.
"
"I got to meet with some new friends today. Feeling optimistic about the future. Lots to still do.
"
I was decently productive today. I'm slowly working towards my exam for Wednesday.
"The last few days have been sort of stressful. My Biology Exam did not go as well as I wanted it to. But I am ready to bounce back. I will spend this reading week preparing for my next Midterm.

I am thankful for all the opportuinities I have, as well as the friends I have."
"The first day of Reading week with my family.
Good time to spend relaxing and reorienting myself.
Really thankful for the time today, as well as the self reflection time."
"Today went well, although I should have been more productive"
Decently Productive Day. I think I found a working method to stay focused.
"Today went good, I wanted to get some stuff done but I was just feeling unmotivated. Hopefully tomorrow goes well."
Today I went to the dentist. Thankfully nothing major. I want to be able to accept myself.
"Today went well, I want to be more productive in the future. I will continue to journal offline to help me clear my mind."
Today was a great start. But I just burned out at the end and didn't get anything done.
"  I went to bed early last night, can't remember when I fell asleep, but I slept well. I got up at 7 a.m., then I had breakfast, after that I went to class. When I came out of my class, I found the weather was good, so I went back and changed a thin coat. My French professor handed out our Quiz, I thought I'd do better on it, but I didn't. Next year I don't think I can continue to learn intermediate French, cause there will be many many psychology courses I need to take. Anyway, I've chosen all my summer courses today, photojournalism is in WList, but it's fine."
"Nothing special, Iâ€™v done my first midterm. Psychology talked about some Freudâ€™s theory. Iâ€™m still concerning about taking intermediate French, I donâ€™t know, maybe I should try, maybe not. "
"A normal day, just as usual, nothing special. I called my mom tonight. I always feel that I'm wasting time and money in college. Sometimes I try to get over all my bad habits, but it never really worked, maybe I just didn't really try, or I try not hard enough, I don't know. On the one hand, I'm disappointed in myself, on the other hand, I'm still living the way I hate, day after day.  Although I feel depressed and being so negative in every night, I'm a positive person, at least I think so. Actually I do, all my friends love my jokes, I'm a good listener, I'm always being nice. But I know that ain't me, it never is. It seems that I'm pretend something that makes me feel good about myself. And I hate that. I don't know which one is really me. I feel bad about that. I started to miss my family, to be homesick. Is it because now it's night or something? Cause I found I always turning into weak during night time. I know I should be responsible for myself, but I'm already exhausted, though it seems that I've done nothing. Anyway, tomorrow gonna be a good day."
"Nothing special, next week gonna be really busy. Hopefully I can have a good weekend."
"Studying for my exam, this week I have 5 exams, my psychology exam is on Wednesday, and other exams all on Friday. I feel depressed and started to think that I made the wrong decision. Maybe I shouldn't learn psychology. If I continue to learn commerce, everything would be totally different.
"
Busy day. Studying for my second psychology exam.
"Studying for my exams, tomorrow gonna be a really busy day. This week I need to focus on my exams, so sometimes I forgot to write my journal, next week I will be fine."
"I've done all my exams! The hearing part of the French Test was really hard. Fortunately, I did ok on ANTA's exams."
"Nothing special. I woke up late today, so I missed my class. We decided what are we going to say for our French oral exam in the afternoon. Exam#2's grade was uploaded in the evening, I think it's better than I thought, I thought I did worse than last time,   but actually it's better. I hope I could do better than this time in the final exam."
"It seems that I'm a really boring person, I felt every journal I would write something like ""nothing special"" or ""a normal day"". Maybe I just didn't pay any attention to interesting things.  It seems every day is the same for me. Anyway, today is nothing special, that's true, but it's a good day for me, cause nothing bad happened. So, that's it, I guess."
"Today was overall a good day. I spent some time with my friends, but also continued to study for my final exams coming up. It started to rain and snow today, so the weather kind of put my mood down. The bus ride home took much longer due to the weather and traffic conditions. A typical bus ride would be about 45 minutes to an hour, but today it was over 2 hours. I tried to not let that discourage me from my good mood any more, so on the bus ride home I was able to get some work done on my computer. That made me feel very productive. "
"Today was Friday and it wasn't too bad of a day. It was chilly outside and was a cold walk to campus, but it wasn't anything to complain about. We had our last chemistry lab today which was nice, we were given some practice worksheets for the final exam. I could feel my self doubt starting to come in as I was finding the material difficult to try and start. This made me feel more stressed about the exam, but i am committed to making time over this weekend, and the next week to prepare for my final exam. I wish to receive my desired grade, as I would love to do nothing more as my career than to become a pharmacist. I know it takes a lot of work to get to that point, and I am willing to accept any failure that may arise, but to also bounce back from that and to learn to become successful in more ways than one. "
"Today was a great day. I went to work for the morning, and it wasn't too busy, which made the day go by more easily. At the end of my shift my parents and I went to our close friend's house for their daughters 9th birthday party. It was a lovely to see them, and to spend some time with them. "
"Today I had the day off which was nice. I was able to sleep in this morning, and was able to have enough time in the day to study for my upcoming psychology exam. The more time allow myself to study and to understand the information, the more prepared I am feeling for this exam. "
"My day hasnt started quite yet, but I have already had a great morning. I plan to have a great day today regardless of whatever may come my way. I also intend to get a satisfying amount of work done throughout the day, to give me more tim eand effort to study for an upcoming exam this weekend. "
"Today was a very good day. I spent the day with my friends Haylea and Sam at school. We laughed and did our homework, and my sister picked me up from school. I was having some trouble and had some things on my mind, i was able to talk to her about what i was feeling and it made me feel better. We picked up my niece from school, went to the thrift store and went to my house for supper. I also received my exam grade from my psychology exam last Wednesday evening, and I did much better than I thought. I have another exam tomorrow, and I wish to do the same or even better, as i did not do well the first time taking the course. "
"Today was a good day. I worked and it was nice to see some of my co-workers. I didn't work for a couple weeks so it was nice to be back. When i got home, i did some homework and felt ready and prepared to begin studying for my two midterms that i have coming up on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday evening. I hope they all go well, and i am looking forward our study break the week after. "
"I am writing this for yesterday (Feb 10) and it was a good day. I got to spend some time with some good friends. we laughed and talked about many things, and helped each other out with some work. We also have an exam coming on Thursday and we began to study for it together. "
"Today has been a nice day so far. It is Monday and the beginning of our study break for school. I have allowed myself to be somewhat lazy, yet productive. I allowed myself to sleep in but I have also been getting some homework and assignments done beforehand, so i am not too stressed out about not having them done later on. "
"This is for my day yesterday, but regardless I had a good day. I was off and felt productive getting lots of work done, I even finished a couple assignments this morning that i did not think i would be able to finish. "
"Today was a good day. It's Sunday and our winter study break is over. I had a great week but I am also looking forward to going back to school, to get back into the routine of things and seeing my close friends everyday "
Today was a good day. I spent the day with my family and studied for my test tomorrow morning
"I didn't do much for my health today, I meant to have a plan but I was too exhausted to carry it through. I am disappointed in myself and I want to try harder."

I had a great day. I saw my friends and had a very interesting psych lab. I also got to facetime my parents who got me very excited for reading week.
"I woke up feeling quite tired, but it is Halloween and I am excited to see my friends later tonight!"
I woke up feeling refreshed and ready for my day. I went and saw a play for my English class with my friend which was really fun! I got a little tired and was unable to work on my essay which made a little stressed but I know it will be ok
I only has one class today so that was nice. I came back and got a lot of work done which I was very proud of. I am going home tomorrow for fall break and I cant wait
"I am finally home on reading week! I love being in my own bed and being around my family. Tomorrow I am going to see some of my friends who I have not seen in a long time and I am excited to catch up with them, I'm starting to realize it is nice to take a break from school work once and a while!"
"Woke up feeling very refreshed. I was a little stressed out because I am having some trouble writing an essay, but I am excited to see my friends later "
"Today I came back to school after reading week. I miss my family and I wish I could spend more time with them, I am happy though that it is almost Christmas break and I can go back home. I am very grateful for my family and I cherish them so much"
"Today I had a great day. I woke up feeling refreshed and ready to go, I had an 8:30 class so I was a little stressed but I made myself get up and go which I am now proud of. I am feeling grateful to attend university today. I am enjoying all my classes and I am exciting o see what my future will bring!"
I just got back from spending the weekend at StFX university visiting my best friend. I had such a great weekend and I made some new friends as well. It got me excited for Christmas break because I get to see her again. 
Today I went to a coffee shop and worked on my paper. I'm grateful that Halifax has nice coffee shops because I find I work best at them! 
I studied for my midterm coming up and it is stressful.
I studied for psych again for the entire day. I got all the lectures out of the way and started reading the textbook. 
I had to do an assignment on Macbeth which brought back memories from high school.
I booked my flights for summer
Abby is on her way to visit
its an ok day
I need to study for stats
I watched a movie with family and did homework
Coming back after reading week was hard i missed being relaxed at home
I took a mental health day and didnâ€™t go to class but caught up and went to tutoring and had a good day with my friends
I had a really bad day i found out i gained a lot of weight and cried for hours and was stressed about a midterm i wrote and then suggest a break from my boyfriend but then talked to my best friend and realized that isnâ€™t what will help me i need to help myself by going to a professional 
I hung out with my friends went to all my classes and talked to my mom
I was hungover and exhausted but not super streased
iâ€™m very stressed this week is so friggen busy
i wrote my midterm today and get awful about ut
Iâ€™m exhausted even though i slept a lot but my best friends came and visited me
I went home for the day and had a really good stress free day 
I found out i failed a midterm and was in a bit of a slump today
the corona virus closed down school and im nervous but confident i can stay on top of my work
i completed the Q life videos and feel like iâ€™ve learned so much
packed up my res and saw my parents 
Teachers started giving instructions for the rest of the year which was stressful but i feel capable 
Getting things organized so that when I come back on  Monday I don't have to rush to catch up 
Leaving home after a long break is always hard.
"first day back, started some studying and notes for upcoming exams."
some math work got the better of me but I completed it! 
Stress about out of school problems 
"I went an advisory meeting, did some school work and studied."
"woke up feeling great, ate healthy, also went to the gym."
"I woke up at 5am to receive word on going to work (snow removal). It was a go so I made breakfast and coffee and went.  I shovelled for 5 hours. I have been feeling sick the last few days but it hasn't gotten worse than a sore throat and head ache. I already have most of my next essay done so that does not concern me.  

Things with my Girlfriend have been great so far today, she has been full of love and energy despite also feeling under the weather. 

I took a long bath to ease my sore body from the hard work and I am about to get back to the essay after finishing my Q-life material. 

I am excited about tomorrow when I can pass in another essay successfully. One step closer to being a clinical psychologist. Also have an exciting meeting at the yoga studio tomorrow. "
"I have been on an up swing today. My girlfriend and I were having an awful fight for about 24 hours and I am also recovering from becoming quite sick last week. 

I fell behind in school because of being so sick and also not acting entirely forthrightly. I have a massive problem with smoking too much weed.  I smoke significantly less than usual, but I am still doing so on a daily basis.  After almost a week of relapse I begin to feel the more chronic and familiar haze of heavy usage return. No amount of sleep will give the chronic stoner energy like one could have without so much hitting of the herb. I really need to remind myself of my reasons not to smoke. 

Otherwise, Things have been settling down. I must remember my gratitude for my friends, animals, and house and opportunity for school to keep my grounded. Hell, even this very day and each breath and beat of my heart are unguaranteed gifts at each occurrence.  How many free beats of my heart did I receive as gifts from nature in the time it takes me to write this? More than I can ever repay, thus, it is my moral duty to stay true to the truth and the good. To be courageous and brave in the face of life and live it honestly. That is part of my missions statement. 

I hope to catch up with school, ace my assignments and exams like I know I can and have done before. Then prepare to get on a hard send of making money during the study break so I can pay March's rent. 

Heres to the ever increasing in difficulty challenge of life, little does life know, each challenge makes me stronger, and I can thus surmount even more. So bring it on! "
Pretty dece
sick stuff rock climbing 
Today is my reading break and I have a lot to catch up on but I am taking a break before I do. I am super excited to see my friend who moved away and to go out and get food and catch up later. 
Today was actually good but when i received a mail from my school about my school fees i was devastated
Hopefully fantastic 
Today seems so nice 
Today seems promising 
"today i did a lot of school work, i realized that i got the wrong time for one of my labs so i got very stressed out, but i ended up fixing things the best i could and moving forward. i have been trying to eat healthier, and was planning on working out but ran out of time- i did work out yesterday "
"Last night i didnt get much sleep, and nanie went to the hospital early because she fell so i was up at 445 with chris to go. she is okay but broke part of her leg. she is getting old. other than that ive had school and im currently in between classes getting ahead of some school work"
"today u worked, i did some school work and i visited nanie. she is doing well but was tired. i decided my mission statement is that i want to be doing something that makes myself proud. i had a thought today about becoming a human rights lawyer. i hink it would be amazing but i dont know if i could do it. i have to do more research."
"Today i went to school from janet and steves, i went to my make up lab, and i have tomorrow off to get all of my school work done, so feeling like im getting a hold of things well. going to do a bit more school work tonight so i dont have loads tomorrow. it was nanie hares 93 birthday today, so chris dad tami and i went to see her and have supper with her. she was feeling okay but didnt eat much. "
Today is Valentineâ€™s Day and so donavon and I spent last night and today at janets. We are house sitting for them but it was really nice just the two of us hanging out all day. We had a really nice supper steak double stuffed potatoes and salad. Christina has been annoying. 
I had work and now Iâ€™m at janets with Chris. Felt stressed 
I need to start being healthy again I feel gross mentally and physically when I eat bad and donâ€™t exercise but I canâ€™t seem to get myself to do it 
At janets did some school work 
Today I did schoolwork Iâ€™m still at janets but itâ€™s been nice to have some time to myself 
"today i did some studying, i went to the gym and walked home afterwords, and i hung out with christina. i think that i want to start reading more- i kinda miss it. ive also been thinking about cutting down my social media by deleting instagram, but im not sure yet. i feel like it could be refreshing. 
"
"i went to the gym, went to choir, and went with dad to take baloo to the vet so she could get her little tube out. ive been feeling better since ive started going to the gym(i know its only been 2 days but i can feel it already) i often start going and then stop after a couple days, or  a week, but im hoping i can actually do it this time :)"
"got a lot of school work done, i worked out at home- four days in a row so far!(home or gym)  i can feel myself just continuing to elevate."
"had school today, a quiz in gwst which i think it did good on, i went to the gym and the weather was really bad so i got dad to pick me up after. now i am with donavon "
"i was feeling good this morning, i went to work and then after i hung out with Carmen. but i didn't eat as well as normal(not horrible but not great) and i didn't go the gym, and so i am feeling a bit disappointed. i know its just one day but i really want to get things on track and i think that the best way for me to do that is to be consistent. i was feeling stressed earlier- i set up an interview at coras, and im trying to figure myself out for vet school and to send a letter and resume around to different vet clinics. Dad and sandy have reminded me how hard vet school is and it is making me start to doubt myself. i hope i am smart enough and that my mental health doesnt get in the way of me becoming who i want to be. "
just did school work. i have an exam wed
"had an exam today which i think went well, saw paul for a little bit which was nice"
"i went to school today, i saw donavon really quickly which was really nice because i havent seen him for a bit because hes been sick so i miss him. i went to the gym also which makes me feel good about myself. i am still in the habit of snakcing, but i am now snacking healthier which is a good start. i know i should only eat if im hungry though so i will work on it. also i signed up for my precal course! i am applying fro pre vet tomrroow with sandy"
i felt a bit unmotivated today which was annoying because i dont want to fall back into those ways. i tried to work out but it was really hard to make myself and then my hips were bothering me so i stopped. dad sandy chris and i made pizza and had carrot cake tonight. it was really nice we all spoke about some things that were bothering us.
"today i am grateful that i was able to write poetry. i havent written much lately and it felt nice to be able to do it again. chris and i took baloo and finn to T lake, i did my school work. nanie has been in the hospital bc she had surgery on her leg. she made it through though and is starting to feel better so that is good. im going in to visit her tomorrow before school. "
i called in sick to work today bc i was throwing up last night. i felt pretty good today other than that. i took baloo to yorkre doubt with chris and coronavirus is happening and so everything is starting to get shut down
"donavon slept over last night so he was here this morning till about 12. then i did some school work, took baloo for a walk with chris, and thats about it. we are supposed to be social distancing right now because of covid 19 so there isnt much to do"
Nice day.
Good overall day. Feeling good about school and keeping busy with my life. 
I woke up feeling energized. I had a bath and had breakfast after which I went to school. So far I will say my day is going on smoothly.
It was a nice day though very busy.
My day was a bit rough at the beginning but it picked up. 
It was an exciting day. Everything worked as planned. I achieved all my set goals.
It was a busy day for me but somehow I made it through.
this morning and most of the day was the first day I didnt feel anxious and it felt so amazing. later in the day I got anxious but not as bad as normal. I have a lot fo heavy thoughts in my head right now and don't want to think or deal with them 
It was boring
"It's the first day back from reading week, and I was really productive in the past week. I didn't procrastinate, and I took care of myself, and I wanted to continue that as I went back to uni. However, today I did not follow the plan in my Happy Planner, and I'm a little disappointed in myself about that. I wanted to complete my post-lab for psych, and I didn't. I looked at houses for rent instead. Tomorrow is a new day though, and I'll try better tomorrow to focus on my schoolwork."
"Today went by quick so that was nice, I was not as productive after my classes as I originally planned to be but I know I have the weekend ahead of me to make progress and be productive. I did not workout today but I still did a bit of walking and am going to work for 5 hours tonight. The weather was nice so that helped my mood a lot today I think. "
Spent the day doing school work which was kind of boring but made me feel productive. Not really looking forward to school tomorrow but it's getting closer to summer break.
"Classes weren't too bad today, forgot to charge my laptop last night which sucked a little but was an easy solution to take notes on my phone and I still got them all. Felt good in biomech lab (not so much last week's assignment), knew what I was doing on this assignment for the most part and got most of it done. My friend was sad which wasn't good but I tried to give some advice that will hopefully help. I took my brother to the pool tonight too (and I did a workout earlier too), good for him because he likes to swim and go out, good for me because it was a little bit of activity and got me out of the house doing something more physical. Listened to a bit of music (found a new playlist), started a bit of studying, did this journal, made a mental game-plan for my plans tomorrow. Ready for tomorrow (mostly because it's another day closer to summer though)."
"Today wasn't too bad. I liked my outfit, classes went well, i went to the gym, went out with my mom. Got a little upset about one thing but moved past it, just didn't focus on it and shifted that focus elsewhere. Got a bit of work done again. Mental planning and keeping track of everything that I've done and that has to be done is helping me to feel on top of things and keep everything in line so its getting done."
"Writing about yesterday (February 29th)

I felt very tired after a stressful week at school. I spent a bit of time working on homework, but most of my day was watching Netflix. I wish I had engaged in some physical activity. I was happy though that I got to hang out with a friend that I had not seen in a while. It was nice to re-connect and share what has been happening in our lives. I want to get lots of homework done today and prepare myself mentally for my upcoming week. "
"Today I woke up early and ate breakfast which is something that I do not always do. I prepared for my presentation with my advisor and gave a good presentation. I am happy with how the presentation went and now feel that I am ready to continue working on my independent study. I am grateful for my advisor for all that he has and is doing for my education. My girlfriend came back home after being away for a night. I now feel less tense and happier that she is home. I was able to go grocery shopping with her and I am proud of myself that I went with her. I am not always able to go due to not scheduling my time properly. We ate a nice dinner and talked about our objectives for the rest of the week. This made me feel less anxious. I am going to bed by 9:30 pm so I can wake up and plan my day. By doing so, I will be able to stay on track with my vision."
"Today was really busy and stressful, I had a huge project to finish and I didn't really know how to finish it."
"I'm feeling extremely overwhelmed by everything going on right now. I am unable to keep up with my workload, and I am really struggling to learn in this online environment. "
"My day was okay. I am looking forward to tonight to see one of my friends who lives in truo. Last night my roommate and I got one some bad terms as she was disrespecting myself and the rules/values of the apartment so I am not looking forward to seeing her, but other than that I think today will go okay."
"I spent the majority of the day in a vehicle, and I meant to do way more school done than I did."
"I had a good day at school, I could have been more productive in school today but I had a good chat with my roommate, made a good dinner and hung out with my friends which was very much needed. I am very thankful for my boyfriend who supports me though everything and anything. I am working on school a bit more now for sociology I am hoping to complete my condensed notes for my midterm."
Today was good but okay I had a hair appointment so now I feel more confident about myself. Started my biomechanics assignment but feeling overwhelmed for the soc midterm tomorrow 
Today I had a sociology midterm and jr went better than I thought considering a lack of studding. I was able to hang out with my friends and accomplish some school but I am stressed about my biomechanics meeting and wuiz tomorrow on projectile motion but happy to get some clarity. 
Today was a good day. A few events stressed me out but overall I was okah
"Today is so far good, I am planning to go to the gym later. I have a quiz up next but it shouldn't be too bad. I am looking forward to starting the weekend!"
Today I went to bridgetown to spend time with my boyfriend and watch him play some hockey. His Dad brought me tea to the game and itâ€™s little things like that that mean the most to me. 
I was very sick today. I woke up at 3am and was in the bathroom till 8am. I missed my classes and am very overwhelmed about school and my health 
I was still a bit sick today and havenâ€™t been as productive as I needed to be.
I was still very sick today and not feeling well but I got to one class and ate breakfast and supper without throwing up so its a win.
Today is a good day. I woke up not feeling super sick ( win) I know I passed my midterm in physiology not as good as Iâ€™d usually want but considering I was sick I am okay with it! Excited to start the weekend and have time to study the subject I sick at -biomechanics. & see my boyfriend 
Is a good day. No school Monday. Super pumped.
"Today is the first day of ""online school"". I am taking the coronavirus seriously and doing what I can in my part to stay clean and remain sane. I have cleaned my apartment this morning and I am picking away at a lab that is due by Friday. I am hoping to get the rest of my assignments done by Wednesday apart from my essay so I can focus on my online class. All is going well right now, I am going to see my cousin soon but I miss my family at home."
Today is a good day! I am going to finish my physiology lab and my activity lab and just hang out.
Today was a good day! Got caught up in school and went for a walk with my best friend.
"I am having a good day, working on biomechanics. "
Today will be a good day!
"Although I had an eight-hour sleep last night, I still felt tired when I woke up this morning.  I think the rainy weather also had an effect on my attitude and mood. "
"Today started okay, I was late to Physiology this morning which is unfortunate, but I did end up finishing my Phys lab and I feel pretty good about that. Later in the day, I had an okay workout, and then after that I went to the library. I cried a bit at the library due to things going on in my life but it was good to get the emotions out. Jean was a good friend and talked to me during it.  "
"Today was really good surprisingly! Yesterday was pretty shit but today I spent it at smile in the morning, and then after that I had a personal development day for APT. Had fun lifting the weights. I felt a little self-conscious today, more than normal, but I'm realizing that people's opinions don't matter in the end and as long as my life is progressing and I am not hurting anyone then why should I care what people think :) I am a good guy and I need to start believing that."
"I forgot to do the last 2 days of this oops but im going to try and do it every day from now on! I feel content with myself and self aware of the actions I am taking. Today I noticed myself being condensending when I was explaining about my big ""squat"" I did earlier. No need to talk about yourself, just let people find out by themselves how much of an amazing person you CAN be! I had a midterm today for sociology and it went pretty well, was a bunch of short answer questions which didn't take a lot of time. Finished my lab and had a really good back day in the gym. Tomorrow I'm going to be training push. Looking forward to tomorrow! I have a meeting with Elliott and my therapist. gonna be a good one!"
Today I woke up and went to my 8:30 psychology class. After that I went to the gym and worked out (did push) and then came home to drink my mass gainer shake. I went to my guidance councilor and talked about my being less condescending and being able to develop long term relationships. After that I went to my interview for the summer internship and it went well (I hope). I went to APT and took care of the 7pm group of kids. It went very well but it's important to be motivate the kids through functional improvements and not subjective improvements. This is okay because I will take this and learn from it :) I later went to the library and studied for the physiology test all night.
"Today I went to smile in the morning, got to break the Saturday group huddle at the start. Ryerson was amazing today and I had a fun time with him. After Smile I went home and played a little bit of Minecraft to relax and then I went to the library to study"
"Today after research methods I went to the gym and did legs but I felt drained from all the studying, but I am happy that I went and did not skip. After my last lab and talked to Ned after which was pretty cool. I went to go study and then I went to APT and had a really good time there (learned not to wear short shorts anymore lol). I studied all night for my physiology midterm the following morning."
"woke up today feeling oddly energized. I was focused on getting my studying done at the library and was able to get good meals in all day. Last night I remember people commenting on my physical appearance and how I look like I've gained weight and muscle, specifically in my arms! I've been trying to pull myself away from the girl i'm interested in that has been playing with my feelings and it's hard. as well as I am contemplating messaging a girl back home that I used to have a large crush on, I feel very nervous and anxious to see how she would respond if i were to send a message."
"Woke up today feeling a bit down, but went to class and didn't see the girl that I love seeing in class everyday, I've been trying to not talk to her as much so that i'm not coming across as needy. However I feel like I already have or that she doesn't care if she doesn't talk to me through out the day. I did study for 6 hours today and had a very good lift today and workout with tilley. I still think in the back of my head about paige and wanting to talk to her and see her, but i know i have to keep away for a bit. I don't know yet if she is feeling different about not talking with me yet through out the day but i'm hoping to figure that out soon. I still find myself overthinking, that maybe she is hooking up with another guy but every time i get proven wrong and she's just with some people on her team instead. Bright side is that I have been getting a lot of compliments on my progress on my body. I've gained to 215ibs and starting to fill out more and people are noticing that. I also have procrastinated from messaging the girl back home because i'm nervous for her answer. I've really caught myself overthinking everything today. But i'm determined to not let girls take advantage of me and not be too nice anymore."
"wrote 2 mid terms today. 1 went well the other didn't. Studied all day for another mid term and then had a meeting with a ex pro player to train me for the rest of the semester. I can't wait to start to put in the work with him. I also saw a girl at the lib and was able to get her contact and i'm now waiting for her to add me on snap. I'm a bit anxious because i haven't been added yet. I can't get too worked up because she may be busy, I don't know her, but she did give me her snap so she must be kind of interested. I also had a great practice today being able to do more guard work and not play the 5 spot today."
"I did very well on my midterm and got a good grade on my bio midterm. Lifting is going well, my SC coach is very admit on me continuing with these lifts and i will become really good. I have the trainer back home tell me he wants to train me so I should be physically advanced compared to everyone if i follow through. However the thing with the new girl brooke didn't go well. She did add me but our talk didn't last long because she O bombed me. I feel very lonely today and left behind. I'm confused as to why she doesn't give me a chance when I could make her feel like the most loved girl in the world. It's crazy that i say that even though i know nothing about her. I need to stop getting so attached when I haven't even talked to her in person yet. I don't know if I should ask her to coffee or not. It's all confusing and making me very anxious. Im very lost today."
"the past few nights I have been Facetiming Gina. I think we have been hitting it off. She is always happy to see me and hear about my stories and talk. I can't wait to see her in person when i go back to Acadia in 5 months. However, I'm trying to not get too attached to quick. So, i'm still talking to Dora as well and shes making me a bit anxious because she never has any emotion and I don't know if she feels as heavily towards seeing me as I am to see her. Aside from girls, I've been doing my best to keep up with my workouts and keeping my weight up. I need to make a schedule of what to eat on what days to better prepare myself for a days worth of eating. I also need keep reassuring myself, and not doubt myself or worry about others think of me. This isolation is starting to get hard. The boredom is kicking in and I'm resisting the urge to constantly message Gina so I don't seem needy or super invested. Also found out I have chlamydia again... I don't know from who or how long i've had it but it's starting to really frustrate me."
"Almost done my quarantine, get to go outside soon, starting to feel like im accomplishing things for school and things are going great with gina as well"
"Today was good, I had my psych of sport midterm this morning that went well I'd say... then I came back and finished my Phys lab and started the next one. Then I became obsessed with Love is Blind on Netflix "

"Today is Monday, and I was unable to go to class because I am so exhausted from not sleeping. I have been working on homework, and laying in bed."
"I was exhausted this morning, so I had to drink a coffee. Once I had my coffee, I had more energy. I had lots of school work today due to a busy upcoming week, so I sat at my desk and had to do work all day. I am stressed about the upcoming week, so I am probably not going to sleep well tonight. "
"I have an extremely busy week, therefore I am very stressed out about school. It is hard for me to focus on my mental well-being, while trying to excel at school, have a social life, volunteer, and make time for my relationship. I am feeling drained. "

I had a very productive day schoolwork wise. I was very stressed about the upcoming weeks of school as there is so much to do but managed to get ahead on a few assignments!
Today was not a very productive day. I didn't feel as though I could accomplish as much today as I was very tired
Today I had a midterm so I was not especially excited to start my morning. The day went by fast and I had a shift in the evening. I went to the library in between class and my shift and got some work done which made me feel productive. I am looking forward to visiting my family this week
"I had a great night of sleep and will be packing to go home today. I have some homework to finish before then, but overall a good start to the day. I picked up my sister from the airport yesterday so I am excited to show her around campus and for us to travel back home together."
I am packing to go home so I have been very busy but am excited to head home

"
"Today was a low energy day. Rough sleep last night and now I am struggling to pay attention in class. Nevertheless, I am very motivated to get my lab report done, which has been going well. Might take a nap after class to recharge before doing some more studying. Meal hall food was good!"
"Today was good! I went to all of my classes, had breakfast, and wrote a midterm! I ate a very good lunch and am less stressed because one of my commitments got postponed to a later date, freeing up more space."
"Today I spent some time with my niece and nephews, moved out of residence and watched a documentary for my sociology class. Although there is no school, I am very stressed out of anticipation of the school work changes being implemented due to the virus. I know that there is a lot of work to do and I am scared for my family's financials again."
My midterm is going great! Online classes can be a challenge to keep up with procrastination but the classes seem easier than before! Its snowing! A great morning!
today I had a midterm and 3 type interviews which was stressful. tomorrow is my birthday and I am excited about that. I need to finish my lab report which will be nice but I don't really want to do a lot of work on my birthday I am tired and I need to go to bed lol 
"sad about last night. I really care about Maddi and think that her friends think im crazy and I was really upset but there's nothing I can do about it now

I hate corona lol its so stupid literally everyone take a chill pill. please. 
I want to do the second assessment but I cannot see how to do it lol this is the second time this program has not been prepared 
"Had a good day, woke up early, walked my dog, and did homework"
I woke up feeling immediately tired and not motivated to do my work. I did my work because I had to and dread going to class tomorrow. 
I woke up with little energy and having little sleep as I was too stressed to sleep. 
"Woke up feeling energetic, despite not getting enough sleep. Had a good day and was engaged in my classes. "
Had a good day
"I was able to get closer to completing some school projects, and spent some time reading today."
I didn't do the things I needed to to get farther along with school
"Good- got 100% in biology

Bad- didn't study enough for other midterm, likely didn't do well

I need to do a better job of prioritizing how I spend my time 

"
"Finished 2 assignments, feel good to have completed them on time. Was really tired, so had to take a nap during the day. "
Stayed inside all day. 
Got outside for a walk and ate well. Got some work done and started organizing for this week.
I woke up feeling great and ready to go 
Good day
"Today I went to all of my classes and after that I unsuccessfully tried to study. Today was a day where I prioritized my friends and myself. I am still mostly on track in school and everything will work out, but I am a little stressed about my lack of productivity. I am a little bummed out because where I normally study at 7am is closed for renovations. That was a huge reason why I got out of bed in the morning and it will be difficult to find that motivation. This morning I went for a walk which was super nice as well as caught up with a friend. Two other friends asked me to hangout, when they were in need of support and it feels good to be that person for someone else. "
Today I was super hungover and very unproductive. I did draw though which was nice. I didnâ€™t get done what i needed to get done
idk
"it was a pretty quiet and peaceful day, I woke up at 7 am, made my schedule for the day, had a shower, went to have breakfast at 8, took a good hour to relax and have a good meal, went to the library at 9:15, studied until 2, had lunch, came back to my room. Had a 26min nap, did y statistics assignment for next Friday. And now I am relaxing while listening to the Q-life videos and doing the exercises in my student life companion."
"Today was an interesting day, it went by quickly. I had a midterm in which I felt confident, my classes were interesting and engaging, I exercised, laughed with my friends, talked to my other friends from Colombia, conversed with my parents and sister. I attended an engaging and instructive meeting today that has left me wondering about a great deal of many things, things that will impact my future in a very significant way, and the most exciting and concerning thing for me is that the impact they have is going to be dictated on the choices I make in this month of march on the year of 2020. A lot of things are going to happen in this next month, in this next year, and in this next decade. 

That seems... unbelievable to a certain extent, the sheer fact that I will graduate college, probably continue studying and become a doctor or something else, start working, statistically, I should find the love of my life, maybe settle, start thinking about having kids, retirement plans, all those things, which I know will come in their due time, and I am not worried about them right now, that would be foolish and unproductive, I am just amazed and excited about the fact that all these amazing, challenging and beautiful things will happen in this next decade. I am excited to see what happens. Hopefully, I can read this in 2030, and remember what my 19 (almost) year old self was thinking, wondering 10 years into the future
"
"Today I felt like I socialized more than usual which made me feel better about my day. I am stressed about getting everything done for the weeks coming up, and also trying to work on myself. "
Feeling overwhelmed but trying to plan things so I don't get too stressed out.
I got a lot of work done today!
Today I studied a lot for my midterms I have next week and got the rest of my week organized. I spent some time with friends as well. 
its weird living in quarantine. I feel like I'm not motivated to get up and get stuff done and I procrastinate my school work. 
This morning I woke up at 8:30am and got ready for the day. I'm on Accutane for my acne so I cannot wear makeup which makes me feel insecure and not want to leave my room. I also got my Biology and Chemistry midterms back and I didn't do too well on either of them. I then had a Chemistry Lab from 1:30pm-4:30pm which always stress me out and give me anxiety. 
"Was late the chem again, but i still went. I also forgot to charge my laptop last night, and so i had to charge it during one of my classes. Got my geo midterm back, got a 75 which is eh. But the class average was about 59 so i think that's ok"
"I just kind of started to let the day go, and thought like, ""this might as well happen today"" but afterward I went for a walk and did my homework at a cafe. Had another ""me"" day. I've been having a lot of these lately"
I had classes and they all went well. I got a midterm grade back and it was better than I was expecting. I got to go out for dinner for my friend's birthday. I also had a three-hour nap this afternoon which made my day less productive. 
I slept in and then worked on homework. Nothing really to stressful just trying to get farther in a project 
Had a very relaxing restful day 
Felt good
it was long and rainy but i was productive 
Hung over and unproductive
"Today so far has been an okay day, could've been better but also could've been worse, im really stressed about school especially my exercise physiology course, I feel like im getting quite overwhelmed with the classes online and keeping up with all my school work, everything thing is happening very quickly and im worried about what my grades will be at the end of the semester. "
It is the last day that I have before the stress of the next 3 weeks hit. I am so excited to be finished year 2 but not excited to be extremely stressed for the litttle bit
Very mentally tired and very nervous for the next few weeks of school.
"It is tuesday i am not feeling too bad today, I have lot to do today and i need study a lot for my midterm.I am alwasy stressing over biomechanics"
I had a midterm today and it did not go amazing but i need to finish an entire phys lab in one night and i m very stressed and i feel pressured to go out this weekend when i really do not want to because I am so tired and just want to lie in bed and recharge
It is almost the weekend. I am very stressed about getting a summer job but i am hoping to apply to a lot of places this weekend.
I am so stressed i cant even get out of bed.These next 2 weeks are so stressful and one midterm will determine if I pass the class or not 
"It is tuesday, I have a lot of work to get done today but not feeling as bad as yesterday "
I have 5 hrs to learn all of my physiology thing tommorrow so im a little nervous but i think i can do it
"I am stuck in isolation because of the virus and my dad is working from home and there is not much to do, I am. little stressed because it is hard to keep tract of all your online school things when there is not really a good sense of time "
Today was the perfect amount of self-structured for me to function well and be productive.
I made a really good schedule for today but I slept through my alarm and so I was really behind and got 2 more hours of sleep than I wanted to. After that it was hard to feel back on track. 
:)
i have had a very unproductive day
"Today was a day full of helping my friends pack, I do not look forward to tomorrow as 2 of my friends are travelling home

"Exams and final papers, never enough time to do it all....biggest part is that I can't be the mom I want to be during times like this. "
"Overwhelmed looking ahead at everything due, trying to make sure I fit in time for it all and still take care of kids.  One thing at a time is all I can do."
So much to do still for school but now the kids are here 24/7......trying to push forward a bit at a time but it feels like I'm just not going to get everything done on time. 
I am tired of quarantine but I like not having so many responsibilities 
I am always bored but I am happy that I got to talk to my friends last night
i have headache
"i miss my friends but need to find work to do for summer
I need to be active today"
"Today, I woke up tired because I stayed up late studying. That made it very difficult to wake up this morning, and it also put me on edge all day because I was tired and under prepared. Overall, I will focus on getting more sleep tonight to help me study and do work tomorrow."
Today I actually did the things I outlined that needed to be done. I needed to get homework done and I did. I wrote detailed comments in my SMILE book and it was an overall good day.
"I did not get much sleep, procrastinated an assignment and now i don't know when Ill get it done, and I am still torn about a personal problem and how to act towards it
"

"I have been travelling home all day today. Although it has been stressful, it is good because I am just taking it day by day and only worrying about what I can control."
Yesterday and today have been better than my other quarantine days 
"Today I finally unpacked from my trip home, and my sister and I painted murals to cheer up the people of the community"

"Feeling a bit worn down, but looking forward to the weekend to regroup. "
Chem assignment was diffucult
Feeling defeat.
I feel empowered about my work today.
Grateful for my family.
Biology lab is unorganized and makes it difficult to succeed.
Feeling excited for the weekend to catchup.
"So far I've had a really great breakfast and lunch, a productive workout, and two lectures. I have not been feeling as optimistic and relaxed as I usually do but I think a large reason for that is because my Facebook was hacked and it caused a really inappropriate video to be sent to everyone I have on Facebook which really stressed me out and made me feel really guilty even though I didn't actually do anything wrong. This only happened about 15 mins ago so after an hour or so I'm sure it won't be on my mind as much and I can get back into being in the present moment, feeling good, and getting my work done. Also, I'm going to Halifax tomorrow which I'm SO EXCITED about!! :)))"
"Feeling a bit lonely today, miss my family and my friends back home"
COVID-19 day one of school closure.

"Today has been ok. I went to bed last night feeling like a accomplished a lot but couldn't help but miss Alex. 
Today was less overwhelming than yesterday, still taking it hour by hour. 
i am ok when i am busy because i dont have enough time to think. 
I am feeling less anxious than i have been in the past few months but more sad than i usually am
Im not excited about anything, pretty sad, just going through the motions because thats what i have to do. Hoping that this is over soon. "
"Last night after logging i spoke with my mom and found out that nanny has vasular dementia.. it was a little hard to hear, but easier because she has decided to stay in bc and is doing well there. Im happy that she is getting taken care of now but worried for her future, i dont think my famiky understands what vascular dementia is like... and the reality that she will likely end up in a home.. 
My first reaction was to text alex, and i did. I dont think i did it because i was upset and needed the support i think i did it because i just wanted to talk to her, she called and we chatted. it wasnt as hard as i thought it was going to be. I went to bed in a better mood than the night started, after trying on a bunch or morgans clothes that she was giving away. 

Today was ok, not as stressed out as the rest of the week, interview went well i think. 
Went to the gym, saw some people i liked and chatted with them, actually felt like a part of a community for the first time in a long time. 

Plans for the weekens are to study all weekend and try to catch up in school.. no partying for me, but i took some time last night and tonight to regroup, feeling a bit better about myself. Started trying some ""self care"" simply enjoying my night time routine, whitening my teeth. thats all but it makes bed time a bit more enjoyable. 

im also enjoying journaling, i actually look forward to it throughout the day. i think i will keep doing it.

hopefully this keeps up, its like having someone to talk to without actually having to see anyone. which is what i need right now. "
"Writing about today and yesterday because i missed my blog
Yesterday was busy, had school, studied, had a meeting about courses, went to look at appt with girls, went to alexs to get notes and had supper with her, went home and studied, then had to go to the axe at 11 pm - 130 pm for a rugby fundraiser. 

School was fine, didnt do well on my quiz but didnt really care, meeting was overwhelimg because i dont have time to look at courses. 
Going to alexs was ok, didnt get to emotional which i thought was weird. i really dont know how i feel about the breakup. 
studying went good last night, was productive,

Had to go to the axe for a fundraiser, was pretty fun actually. Only bad part was having to be out really late when i was already tired. Couldnt sleep last night, cat kept me up and was too stimulated. 
Woke up this morning grumpy but determined to be productive. Went to the library, was doing ok with studying.. got a littel frustrated because i was so tired. Alexis found me while i was writing this and we decided to go for a cap.

Woke up after feeling really refreshed and ready to get som ework done. Back at the library now ready to study. I think i shoulf try to spend more time with alexis inthe next couple weeks. she is a good influence on me mentally. 

Feeling hopeful that tonights studying will be productive."
"I forgot to journal last night, but i think thats because alex came over
I studdied for most of the day yesterday again, this week is crazy. but i had supper with dad and it was actually really enjoyable. i didnt like the food but dad is being very respectful of the boundaries im trying to set with myself which is helpful. he isnt pushing to talk about things and if i say im too busy he doesnt push it. Moms getting there too. i think shes taking it a little more personal because i am talking to dad instead of her. but thats ok. whatever works for me and thats what im doing.
I studdied a lot today, i also think i found a place to live until may. holly and her room mates have a room. its a little out of my rice range so i may try to stay at home for a week and then at morgans for another week before i move in there, to save myseld some money. and because im not quite ready to actually be moved out of home. i miss alex. sometimes i get really sad. most of the time im too busy to even realize that things have changed because im so focused on getting things done. but then times like today when i had a nap, it hits me that if i get a place then im actually moving out, which makes me sad. i think i think about her so much that i forget that were broken up. i think thats pretty crazy, it makes me realize how busy i was 
 when we were together, i really didnt spend as much time with her as i think i did, maybe. im not sure about that one. 
today was good. i feel good about my midterms tomorrow, studying all weekend was definitely worth it. 
im going to go back to alexs tomorrow and stay there for a while. not sure how long, but im not going to tell mom. shes putting too many opinions on me, im not really liking talking to her about things lately. 
I find ive been resentful towards my parents the last few days, or really since alex and i broke up. dad was better today. they nboth have  just been non stop bugging me about it. i told dad that im going through a break up, not dying. 
But really i dont know if i know that myself sometimes. the other night was scary, i had a panic attach on saturday night. oi couldnt stop crying, i didnt want to exist anymore. i dont know if its because i missed alex or want her back, i dont think so, maybe contributing? i was just so sad i couldnt contain it anymore. i think once in a while all of the emotions i suppressed for the last six months come out at once. it was scary. i actually thought about self harm. I got a knife out and everything, i havnt thought about that in almost ten years. that was a scary moment for me. when i woke up in the morning and saw the knife on the counter i was relived that i didnt do it. i dont really know why i wanted to, i dont want to, but in that moment its just where my head went. not really sure what to make of that. 
today was better. im still sad in my heart though. alex was over on sunday night, i invited her over for a movie. i think i just missed her. we kissed, i thought we were going to have sex but she pulled away, which is fine. she asked my why i invited her over, i told her i missed her and wanted to see her. she said there is a lot of emptyness without me there. i told her i honestly dont know what i think of anything right now. i told her i feel numb, i dont think thats the right word for it. i dont feel numb but it also doesnt feel real. i dont really feel like im living my life. maybe its because im so busy. 
i really dont know if im happier now or not. i know there is less stress and worry, but there is also less happiness. less of a roller coaster, but is life supposed to be flat?
anyway.. its late, so i wont do any videos tonight. I
Im liking this journal. "
"long, tiring. 
"
"Had a good day today, staying at home again tonight. i have mixed emotions being home, but i dont think its a bad situation, i can see alex is trying to make barreirs, which im supposed to do, but i dont want to and i dont want her to ? 
anyway, im tired and going to bed, i dont have the energy to journal"
"Woke up after being at Best and Bremners house for the night. Alex drove us home, i was still drunk. woke up in an ok mood. finished my paper and submitted it, took a shower and was making breakfast before going to hollys to look at her room. alex asked where i was going so i told her and she got upset. i guess it wasnt clear where we are at. i thoght it was. Anyways we got in a fight, im in a bad mood, i didnt get the AT position i applied for which is really dispaointing,. i actually wanted it really bad. Anyway, now im sad and dont really want to write. i just want to sleep. im tired of being resonsible i just want to do nothing and there not be consequesnces. i have to work tomorrow and i really dont want to. 
Today sucked. im tired. "
"The last few days have been really stressful, with moving out into moms house and trying to figure out what is going on with school. It's a lot
And i miss alex alot. 
but i had a good night the other night with emily, drank too much but it was fun. i felt dirty that that girl kissed me, A really werid situation. 
im stressed about assignments, ive kind of fallen off of getting the q life done which is upsetting, but like they said, its only a failure if you realize and dont get back on it. so thats what ill try and do. ill try and get back to journaling everyday and getting out for my walks. as of now i  have to go write some papers. 
still not really sure how im feeling, i think im getting a little happier, or atleast doing somethings yesterday that make me happy. underneath I still feel sad really. lifes confusing. i keep having panic attacks. i should go see my therapist again but i dont really like her, and i dont want to drive to wolfville again,
sign. writing all of this is making me feel worse. its strange to have your thoughts on coming out on to paper. weird. anyways. 
sometimes i wonder if people are thinking this and think im nuts because sometimes i write a lot and sometimes i write a little. any ways i have to go."
"Today i did a whole lot of nothing, i literally stayed in bed all day and watched netflix. and it was actually awesome. i didnt really realize that it was a good thing as i was doing it because i was just doing what i wanted to be doing insteraad of what i thought i should be doing. i didnt even know thats what i was doing until alex was texting me and i told her and she was excited for me. i didnt feel any anxiety today. 

I have done some reflexion on my relationship with alex and my situation right now. i am excited for my apartment, i am excited to be on my own and i know thats something i have never gotten to really experience before. im excited for the summer. im hoping i find some friends to hang out with, i know morgan will be there which is awesome, but i do need some more outdoorsy friends. I do know i want alex though. i do miss her, but its becoming more clear to me that i was living the relationship that she wanted, not the relationship that i wanted. im not sure if or when we will get back together, i know i dont want to s=rush things, i need to know that she can take care of herself before i get back in. i dont think she realizes how much she hurt me and how unfair she was to me throughout the last few months. I know she is growing, and she is still doing what she needs to do to get better. I am still figuring out what i need to do to get better, but i think i do feel better being away from such a heavy environment. i did have self harm thoughts last week a few times, one time i almost harmed myself.. i was instantly glad i didnt once i calmed down. i dont really even understand why ifelt that way or what i thought it would do. i reallyy think it was a cry for help. i know i push my family away telling them that im ok all the time, but sometimes i need them and i cant reach out but theyre not there. i dont really understand that part of me. its like i want pepople to know that im not ok, but i dont want to tell them because i dont always want to be checked in on. 
my mom talks about my experience with mental health when i was younger as if it went away sometimes. i know that she knows that ir didnt, but its still embarassing the way she talks about it. 
i dont like being embarassed. i want to be fine, maybe i am. some parts of me think tht i actually am ok but then i twist things to the point that im not.. maybe thats the not okay part. 
I think journaling is helping. i think it quiets my mind a bit, i feel a little less crazy i guess. 

something i learned today was that its ok to take a day off. spending time doing nothing isnt wasted time, its time spent recoving,. its ok to enjoy doing nothing sometimes.

i think that was a lesson alex was trying to teach me, although i think she takes that to an extreme sometimes. haha. 
anyway. today was good, i liked today. im looking forward to tomorrow and i havnt done that in a very long time. 
"
"Today was a lot of ups and downs. I got up and went for s run right away, which i was proud of myself for doing even though i didnt go very far. then did a little workout. got a little discouraged during my workout because i dont like at home workouts, but pushed through a couple things anyway which made me feel good. facetimed with dad which was ok, he said i was being very negative but to be fair he was asking me about school which is really tressful then asking me about moving and where ill live for the next month which is also stressful and upsetting. anyway its done now. 
was just doing nothing when mom got me to spend most of the day helping her build a fire pit and move furniture, which i didnt want to but glad i did because i was outside. i got ran down though. morgan found out today she doesnt have covid 19 so i could come out of isolation. i thought i would be happy but it actually upset me because then i actually had to think about where i was going to go and stay for the next few weeks etc. i dont really know what was happening today. i was anxious and sad. i took a nap and felt a little better, was still tired, called alex before supper. i just felt like i needed to talk to her. i knew just talking to her and knowing we were ok would make me feel better. well as ok as be can be. we chatted and it made me feel better.
im going back there tomorrow, i need to be home for a while, jumping around from place to place is hard on the head, no routine and all that. i know i have to get in the mindset that i wont be sad the whole time im there though. i just need to do my own thing and worry about me. do what i want to do, what i need to do and try not to worry too much how alex will react. thats what i have to do. 
im going to try to set some goals for myself for the next few days while im home

get a routine of getting up and go for a run in the morning, do some workouts.
have healthy breakfasts, i should stop into supplement king and get some protein
have coffee, set up for a day of homework. start treating schoolwork like 9-5 job. 
do some drawing in the evenings.
IF i sleep in the spare room, control my emotions. dont get into a panic, try not to wonder what ale is thinking/feeling about it.
if i sleep in our bed, try to just sleep.
if being there is too much, get out when i need to, not when i think is best for alex. 

Ok, i like these goals, 
and get to bed at 10 pm. 

"
"Today was a lot of ups and downs. I woke up in the morning and felt ok, i thought it was going to be a good day. alex woke up and i could tell right away she wasnt doing well. i tried to just to my thing like i said i would, i did some homework, took a bath, went about my day and it was ok. I wont say i ignored the fact that she had a bad day i guess i was just trying to not take responsibility for her bad day. It went ok. she was very distant, which was hard after how close we have been in the last few days. 
Over all the day was uneventful. we went to bed and i started reading a new book, its about a twins, one gets involved in a controlling abusive relationship. i think maybe it was a trigger for me, not that alex was ever physically abusive. mom thinks she was psychologically. im not really sure. I dont think she ever was intentionally but the outcome was the same.
i do have regrets about our relationship, mostly about how i treated her. all i ever wanted to do was make her happy, but it seemed like all i ever did was upset her. It makes me sad that i could never make her happy, never make her feel like she was a priority. she was my only prority and somehow i didnt do it right. 
I know part of that is because she had some impossible expectations of me, but it still makes it hard. 
I got upset tonight. Last night she went to bed without telling me, which doesnt seem like a huge deal but it was to me. i tried to ognore it, not overthink it like i usually do. i stayed up and painted for a long time which was good. But then she did it again tonight after being so distant and it just got to me, i went to bed to read that book with her, and she didnt want to talk which was ok. she put her book away after a while and went to go to sleep and didnt say goodnight or anything. it stung a bit,  i kept reading but i couldnt stop thinking about this is fair, everynight that im not here she is here alone, she is still trying to maintain her routine that she has made for herself and i am getting in the way of it. It made me think about how i treated her more, and how i have so many regrets of not treating her well enough.

Its like i have two sides in my mind, one side has my emotions and knows how a feel, and it listens to my logic saying that i couldnt have done anything more, but it still hurts. it doesnt make it any easier. 
Even though today kind of sucked and i didnt get out to exercise, i am proud of myself for being able to distance my emotions from reflecting alexs. i had my own emotions at my own times, and when i got overwhlmed and upset in bed i cam to journal. which i do think is the living my values part. i do like to think im getting better at this, my r charge says i am which was encouraging. anyways. i feel better now so i am going to go to sleep, try for a workout or a run tomorrow morning, some homework and thats all i can do. "
"Today flew by crazy fast,
i got up and went for a run, made breakfast, had a shower etc. started cleaning out some art supplies and packed up my winter clothes to bring to dads. i did it somewhat secretly to try to not upset alex, althought i didnt hide the boxes. just the full one. i know its hitting her that im moving out. i think i keep separating the idea of me moving into my apartment means me moving out of her house. im my mind i think i still have both. i still have her. But shes distant, when i asked for a hug today she said not to ask and just to hug me, so i did. but i said i hadnt because she didnt seem like she wanted me to hus her in the last few days. she says she always does, but im the one setting boundaries. and i guess i am, she has made it very clear that she doesnt want this relationship to end and this is my doing. i know that. i just miss her. i hate that this is the way we are now, but sometimes i do get a flash of how she was a few months ago and it reminds me of the amount of anxiety and stress and sadness she has made me feel. this morning it was small, we both had a bad sleep because of the animals but she woke up in a pissed off mood and in a huff. i usually would try to help, but i didnt, i stayed in bed and got more sleep because thats what i needed and what i wanted, so im roud of myself for that. but at the moment i felt the anxiety that i was waking up with for monthsm, and it wasnt a good feeling. i think i am getting better at separating her feelings from my feelings, which i know is healthier for me. i just wish i could help her at the same time. i love her with all my heart. i hate that our relationship is that way it is now. i dont want to lose her.

the girl i came home to on sunday, the girl who was happy and laughing and wanted to be outside and doing thigs and having a fire and drinking for fun, not drinking to cope. thats the girl i fell in love with. the girl that wanted to be around me. that trusted me and cared for me and let me care for her. i wish she hadnt left for so long, it makes it harder when i see her come back for an instant, just to see her go again. 

i know im getting in the way of alexs routine without me here. i feel ad about it. she told me today she thinks it just goes back to how it was when we were dating ""waiting around to see if she will get to hang out with me, to see if i want to hang out with her"". i dont think that fair. sitting on the couch in a huff, not looking at me, not asking me to do anything, smoking the day away does not seem like an invitation to do something. it doesnt now and it hasnt for the last 6 months. that made me upset and a little annoyed. thats not fair. its like this breakup is all my fault. had she taken care of herself from the beginning we wouldnt be here. 

i still dont really know what i want. i dont really feel happy ever. sunday was the first day ive laughed and felt like myself is so long i didnt realize i wasnt being me anymore. that makes me upset. i dont know if im not being me because im happiest around alex or because i just dont have much else in life right now that makes me feel alive. 
im still very confused about a lot of things. im not really excited about my apartment anymore, i think i would be if i knew this summer was going to be fun, but so far it just seems like it might suck. i dont really know what to do to make it more bearable. 
i hope were not on quarantine for a long time. it would be nice to do things with alexis this summer, and get to know sophie. 

Ive been doing some of my goals since i got home. 
I ran today
last night when i was upset i didnt let it consume me, it happened, i journaled then made myself sto thinking and sleep. 
i havnt thought too much about the sleeping situation, im just going to bed with alex everynigth and not asking. if she wants that boundary she can ask for it. 
i have been trying to separate our emotions and not get caught up in my head most of the time, 
i have been drawing, and working on (some) homework. 
i dont really remember my other goals, but i think ill review them and work on more. 

i dont know if i feel any better after this journal. i dont really understand what im feeling. i dont think thats new for me. 
anyway."
"today i started in a mood, i was just my ususal numb self, dad actually noticed as michelle was gone to work. he asked about a few things and was being good about it. i know he was trying to be helpful and encouraging but it just seems like its the same stuff ""day by day"" ""sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do just to get through it"" and of course ""not to make light of a tough situatation, but tough situations only make you stronger"" i literally said yeah fuck that. and ranted about how thats only relevant up to a certain point, and whoever is giving out this shit can fuck off because enough is enough. he asked me what i was doing today to make me happy, i didnt have an answer, he said ""as long as at the end of the day you have haopiness"" i didnt reply and he asked me if i was happy, i said no.
Ive realized im really not happy, im pretty numb, i do things, i dont really notice the days going by. i think about alex sometimes, i dont all the time, but i dont laugh like i do when im with her, nothing seems as funny, i dont feel like smiling, accompishments dont seem satisfying.
i will keep doing what im doing, i will keep running and journaling and getting my life together because thats what i have to do, but the last few days i have been wondering if it all so i can get her back h=with an honest heart that we will be better next time around. i want to tell her, but i know i haev to be sure. if im not thats unfair to her, even though i feel its unfair to her to keep that from her. but i am trying to do what is best for me, i but i do think that maybe at the end of the day what will be best for me and make me the happiest is alex. if were able to change the dynamic of our relationship, i think i would be happiest. i know i cant go back into the same relationship we had, i know i have to figure out what i need. i wish it wasnt taking so long, but i guess it is what it is. "
"Today was a pretty good day. Worked out, studied, figured some stuff out for my courses next year , took carlie to the beach and face timed with Mitch and al. It was a pretty good day. I thought about Alex quite a bit like usual but I think I managed to not get al down today as I usually do. Not as much in my head. I journaled throughout the day when I had thoughts and I think it helped me to not get caught up in it and move on with the day. I think Iâ€™ll try it again tomorrow. 
Tomorrow Iâ€™ll go for my run, and work abbs as well. 
Today was a good day. "
"Today was an interesting day.

I woke up this morning, with a goal of getting my test done, and figuring out the nutrition courses i needed.
I woke up to a text from alex asking to use my credit card to pay for reregistration for work, and i let her and she paid me right away, i thought it was no big deal. Then she was being aggressive for no reason, asking what my plan was, if i was coming back, when i was packing because she didnt want to be there, if i was staying or not as it wasnt safe for me to be coming and going. I understand all that. but she just kept at it and i knew she was trying to pick a fight, i tried my best not to but she persued and said some mean things. She reminded me that im not making the progress that i hope to be making and that ive been unfair to her. It was hurtful, and i got upset, but i just didnt respond. i turned my phone off and made myself get distance from the negativity. I took a shower, and by the time i went back to my phone, she had sent more messages, and was apologizing to me for being hateful and mean. Again i didnt respond. i didnt really know what to say. i felt so many things and almost sent a lot of messages. instead i cried, and i journaled what i thought i wanted to say, but never sent it. i managed to get through my test, although i was crying 5 minutes before it started. I was chatting with brody, and i asked him if he had heard from morgan at all as she wasnt answering me. he said he hadnt, but tried her and on first contact she responded. it made me feel very alone again. i know i havnt done anything to make her mad, but just the fact that she is ignoring me is hard to handle when im already feeling so alone. Brpdy was there for me though, he really does care about me. I wish we were closer so we could hang out more, i might try to this summer more. hes a good person. 
After i got through my test i sorted out my nutrition courses and went downstairs, i was feeling alittle better and alex wasnt on my mind as much. Michelle got snappy at me for wanting food ""too early"" which upset me but whatever, its fine now. Anyway, the day went on and i didnt think about alex too much, which is new for me so i think thats a good thing. I finished my q life videos which felt good to complete. alex texted me when i was getting groceries asking me to respond, we chatted a little bit, and she apologized again. i told her to not be too hard on herself. i have a role to play in this as well, and i know when we are hurting we hurt others. The day went on, i dont feel awesome today, but i do feel good that i was at least able to function after hte morning i had. All i wanted to do was cry and sleep and stay in bed, i had actually planned on it. but i managed to actually somewhat enjoy the day. So im thankful for that. 

Im still not sure what i want or what i need or what im looking for, which is unsettling. But i think im taking baby steps which is all i can do right now really. 
I also made an appt with Bally again for psychology, so i think thats good too. i am starting to wonder if maybe medication is a good idea for me again. Things have been pretty dark lately. 
"
"Today is Monday, start of a new week. I felt very overtired from the weekend and didn't catch up on sport so most of the day I felt like I was sleep walking. I had a full day of classes and a lab that I tired to push through along with going to the gym after class. I feel worried thinking about the upcoming month of classes that is insanely busy "
I have been overtired and irritated most of the day today which has allowed little things to bother me more than they should and effect my moods 
Today I went to all of my classes and did some studying for my upcoming midterms. I ate some fruit for breakfast which I need to start doing more of and I took an extra walk between classes to keep myself moving through a lazy day. 
Today I began selecting courses for next year. I had to make 2 versions of my schedule because I am not sure if I will get my practicum but I am hoping for the best. I ate healthier than usual today which is good. I stayed back from the hockey game to work on my lab and I feel as though that was a good step in time management and working towards my goals. I am stressed about the future but feeling relatively in control. 
Today I had the realization that the Q life program has real benefits to my life. I have been paying much more attention to the way that i talk to myself and the way that i speak to others. I am putting effort into finding the good in things and being much more positive all around. I also had this realization and immediately decided that I wanted to journal it because it hepls me organize my thoughts. 
today I studied and went to all of my classes. I am a queen. a legend. a myth. I went to dance HAHA physical activity. I am shitting bricks for my interview tomorrow. Stay tuned dear diary so that I can fill you in tomorrow <3 ;) ttyl xox
I am not enjoying this quarantine and social isolation due to covid 19 however i understand that social distancing is important to f;atten the curve and keep myself and my family who are all high risk safe. 
"Only worked on stuff for school - studied, copied notes"
Today I got a lot of work done and chose not to go out so that I would feel prepared for my midterms.
Today I had my last mid term of the week and I feel pretty good about it. I played spikeball with my friends it was very fun
"Today was busy, I woke up early to go to the gym and then had two tests. Then I went to work, however I feel as though I was engaged and got a lot of studying done!"
I was very overwhelmed and stressed today :(
Very productive day with optimal time to do work!
Really feeling the quarantine today. I'm excited to do an online work out with my old team tomorrow but worried about getting my homework done first. I miss Lucas a lot 
a relaxing day
i did not do good on the midterm in physiology and i am sad about it because i study so hard.
im stufying for physiology and its frustrating because i feel we arent given enough time on the exam so i am feeling discoruaged to study. 
"I started today with a lack of sleep. The rest of the day was ok although I have had a sore throat for the past few days which really has me feeling awful. I did however manage to finish my biomechanics lab, and started working on the physiology lab which helps reduce stress."
"taught riding lessons for the first time since last summer and they all went well. I then went home, had a much needed nap and finished a lab that I didnt think I was going to be able to do"
"So far, today has been a good day. I got to sleep in and am spending time with friends. I am anxious about school as we cannot have any face to face classes. I am fearful for course selection as I cannot meet with a professor. I am grateful that I got accepted into CSEP which is a step towards my ultimate goal of becoming an Occupational Therapist. The corona virus has brought forth a lot of unknowns and I hope that I will be able to find a good summer job in Wolfville. I would like to go to the gym but it is closed due to the virus. "
I had a test that I am not too sure of. It made my day have a rocky start. 
I had a midterm today and it was successful. it made my day start outright. I have had a stressful weekend so I am taking today to rest. 
"I woke up tired today and remained so throughout the day. I did not get the work on my papers I wanted done and even little things that I thought I could get done after an hour ft I didn't get done. However, this is because a ft with a friend back in Toronto lasted almost four hours and this talk was very positive and uplifting so I accept where I got to today. I woke up, had breakfast, caught up on dishes, enjoyed a hot shower, enjoyed ft, answered messages, made a dinner I very much enjoyed, watched a couple q-life videos, took a nap and here I am. I'm about to journal more extensively in my personal journal, probably watch a little TV, read, and go to bed early. "
"Today I woke up closer to the time that I wanted to compared to other days (only a half hour later). I started my day with yoga and meditation followed with breakfast. I took my time with breakfast this morning since I had extra time by painting my nails and watching a bit more of a documentary. As far as work goes I got two hours down for an assignment, watched a lecture, and spent an hour on the q-life. I got a nap and a quick face time in with my brother as well. Today I felt a bit more blah than yesterday and I'm not sure why. To be fair I did spend last night downloading happy songs from the sixties. Perhaps, it's just the toll of this social distancing we're all going through. Perhaps, tomorrow will be different. 

Today I am grateful for: 1) The health of myself and my loved ones throughout this pandemic. 2) The cozy home I have made out of my little apartment. Having this cozy home that is my own is something I am especially grateful for during this time. 3)That I have cupboards and a freezer full of food.  "
Strenuous and very mentally exhausting but I made dinner 
Thanksgiving was so amazing 
"I did not get a restful sleep leading me to feel extremely tired this morning and I decided to skip my classes, but rather then laying in bed I went to a healthy lunch and walk with my roommates and went to the library to do school work to keep on track for my busy upcoming week. "
TodayI slept in and made a healthy breakfast then went to the gym with friends and had a good workout. I went to the library to finish an assignment and then am going to hang out with friends this evening. 
Today I am tired so I have been unproductive. 
This week I work multiple times and have multiple midterms which is all becoming a lot to handle but I am trying to take it one step at a time and cross things off my to do list one by one.
"Today I woke up not feeling well so I felt as though I could not accomplish what I needed to as well as usual but do to the volume of school work I have this week I have to push through. 
 "
Today I had two midterms both of which I felt I could have prepared more for but throughout my day I took extra time to study and prepare and after writing both I felt confident in my performance. 
"I woke up sick today finding it hard to gather motivation to study and prepare myself for my midterm tomorrow but the weather and sunshine is making my mood better then it could have been.
"
School is cancelled because of the virus outbreak so a lot of stress has been removed from upcoming assignments. 
"Today is day 2 of quarantine and I have chose to not move in with my mom and stay with my roommates and I believe that was a positive decision because I will get more school work done and get to spend time with friends that will be moving home soon.
 "
"Today I woke up with a plan for my day, I completed all the tasks I had assigned for my day and have now set a new routine which includes more physical activity which I find to be most beneficial to my mental and physical well-being.  "
"Today I woke up with a lot of energy so I did an at home work out and then had a healthy breakfast, I decided to take advantage of the time I have and do things that are beneficial to my health such as go for walks, work out, and eat healthy. 
"
"Quiet day, had a linkedin workshop that made me feel inspired. Quiet afternoon, some alone time and a nap! "
"Had a stressful conversation with Brandon this morning about our relationship, regarding the more intimate aspects of it. He was very understanding, as always. Have been feeling down for the rest of the day."
"Went out to supper with Bailey, catsitting Koko."
Spent the day catching movies and watching crap cable tv.

Today wasn't the best day. I didn't get the mark I wanted on an exam I studied really hard for and my anxiety got the best of me. I spent most of the day in a grumpy mood and avoiding people I usually enjoy being around. Hopefully tomorrow will be better!
Finish the Psyo 1012 final exam today
I made pancakes and played with my dog. Then I did some homework and ate lunch.
"I did a lot of school work and preparation for my upcoming work. I visited my grandparents and took my dog for a 30-minute walk. I feel super stressed out and tired. I have so much stuff to do in the next week and a half, I feel very overwhelmed. "
I started my day by driving to my friendâ€™s house and dropping of his glasses - that made me feel good like i am a good friend and then i made it to my 8:30am class which i used to struggle to get to. I was unmotivated to do anything after class so I called my brother and scheduled going for brunch as a bettering coping strategy than smoking weed.
I was moving my stuff back from school today and became very overwhelmed and stressed with how messy my room became with all of the excess stuff I am not used to having (from my dorm). I worried a lot about the COVID-19 virus and my grades. I got myself a few projects for my quarantine. 
"although I had to work today (which is extra stressful during the COVID-19 crisis) Im glad I made money since that always helps me to feel less stressed and a bit better off, I also got a lot of my assignment done that I needed to get through. I didn't get a lot of sleep last night since Im not used to going to bed early anymore or needing to wake up at 5am for a shift. I had time to take a nap before beginning my schoolwork which was nice. It was really nice to get out of the house since I have been inside all week and it was nice to get so much fresh air and focus on something other than school and social media and my phone all day. "
Feeling a bit tired but I have been really productive so that is good
Today was a good day! I got to spend time with family and cuddle my dog
"Relaxed and watched netflix, did/figured out taxes"
"Woke up in a bad mood, but my day gradually got better "
played hockey game and hung out with teammates
I came in feeling organized with what I needed to do. Had some Zoom work meetings this morning. It was nice to see people and interact with everyone both on work related and personal matters re: what is happening in life and how everyone is doing. It was uplifting for sure! 
"Completed the homework required for today session. Worked on CRN project, aim to complete two profiles today."
"It felt like I was unprepared for today, reacting to issues and putting out fires (at least at work).  Hoping for a better tomorrow where I can accomplish things on my to do list."
"Today I did a 15km wash ride first thing in the morning. I was very tired so I didn't do much until lunch. After lunch I did weights, went to get a tasty coffee and snack because lunch was terrible, and now I am procrastinating preparing for my thesis committee meeting tomorrow by filling out my first Daily Log. I just need to re-read my proposal and prepare a list of questions/answers to questions that might come up in the defence, so it's really not that much to do. I am going to put my head down and do it before dinner so I can relax and watch Netflix later before going to sleep early. A lot of people are starting to get sick and I am worried that I am run-down and might catch it. The stress of training camp during a pandemic is weird, it has all the same stresses about crew boats, teammate dynamics, etc., with the extra layer of trying not to feel like we are doing this for nothing, and the guilt of doing something as frivolous as training camp when people are locking down all over the world, getting sick, and dying. Sometimes it feels nice to be able to focus on something like sport, and other times it feels really selfish. "
My day started off slow and I got to go out to the park and listen to a meditation. It felt so wonderful looking at the water and meditating. My calculus tutoring was not as useful as usual but it was very amusing. I'm glad that I'm getting help in it cause I would be completely lost otherwise. It's too bad that I had an awful headache today cause I really wanted to get more done. The yoga practice helped but I didn't manage to make it to the conservatory for a violin practice. I had a great time cooking something new today and I want to spend more time doing it
"I felt really excited about the day when I woke up. I felt like I was going to crush it and I had a very thought out plan for the day. I quickly realized that I felt very tired and I wasn't sure if it's because of my iron or something else. I'm really hoping that this exhaustion issue gets solved soon. I might just be asking too much of myself, I do need to rest more often and take time away from my laptop. 
I felt very proud today though when I looked in the mirror, at least in the morning. I felt very confident in my body.
My day changed when Nicky said that they would be leaving today. I felt unprepared for that and sad, plus Nicky's mood changed and I felt like I couldn't approach them. I didn't get that much done with school, but I still think that I did a good job. I have to remember to take a breath on exams and think critically. I am have been and going to continue actively working on my anxiety. It controls too much of my life at the moment  "
"I felt a mix of emotions today. I felt really excited for the day and I felt like I could be more focused and accomplish more now that I have my ""own"" space. I was really excited about the opportunities with the idea competition and research. At the same time I was feeling lonely in the apartment and I just wasn't feeling very loved and cared for today. I was still going through mom's comments from last night, and the call with her again did not help. I really wish we could have a normal conversation at some point him her caring. 
The one thing I really love though is playing music. I know I'm not good right now but it still brings me so much joy. Orchestra practice was wonderful "
"I feel so tired, I just want my iron back. Or to figure out what is causing this. Wednesdays and Thursdays are always hard but I feel like I made the most out of today. I am so glad that I got to get out to the waterfront today. It was so beautiful and watching the waves was very meditative. I feel worried about mom and I wish she has gone to the doctor earlier, there's not much I can do but to provide support. Hopefully it will be a relatively easy fix. I am weirdly excited for my presentation tomorrow "
I like this

"A little underwhelming but not too bad
"
"nothing special, really/"
Today I had an exam and I am a bit stressed out about it as I am unsure of what to expect with all this online learning. 
Today I woke up feeling fresh. I have done all the deadlines for this week. So maybe I will use the weekend to watch a movie and then review for next week's exam. I'm excited!!!
"I started today not well and fresh like the others. Maybe because I have just received a message that took my mood down. However, I'm not gonna let it ruin the rest of the day! I have things to do, also purposes and goals to achieve. Every day I wake up feeling grateful because I know what I need to do, and I don't feel lost! There were times I felt so though, but not anymore."
"Really struggling with my depression this weekend. Barely have the energy to get out of bed, eat food, or study. However, I'm trying to take it a day at a time and congratulate myself for when I DO accomplish things. I showered today, that's progress. I'm sitting down now to try and do some work - that's progress."
"Today I still struggled with my energy, motivation and sadness. Wanted to sleep and do nothing. BUT! I persevered and actually accomplished a lot."
Tough day. Hard to motivate myself. Felt down. I still accomplished a lot though at least. My birthday is tomorrow! I'm excited for that. The weather outside is beautiful.
Felt good. Productive. Prepped a lot yesterday. Ate well. 
"Today is a very productive day, need to start reviewing for the unit exam for the upcoming week. Overall, very proud of what i achieved."
"I had a meeting first thing, I studied (with breaks for food), and thats pretty much it!"
My time management wasn't good today and so I find myself working into my evening and likely will work on school work until I go to bed again.  I am frustrated that I can't seem to fit everything into a shorter day. 
today I woke up at 9:30 and fed my cats then started on some school work. I had work at 2:30 and enjoyed that and then got to hang out with my boyfriend after work
"Today I had my first chem exam. I think it went alright, but I guess I will find out in a week. I also got an English assignment back where I got a 71, which sucked. But I will try to do better this week. "
Today I feel good I am excited about today. I already do some exercise so I can feel more active today. 
"Didn't get much sleep last night so I was very tired today and unproductive. I completed an exam and did worse than I wanted to, which was disappointing. It's hard to work when I'm constantly fatigued."
"I didn't get much sleep because my cat kept me up. I had to go to the hospital to get an ultrasound because of my thyroid issues, I was so tired the whole day. I didn't eat much, not even a complete meal. I studied all night and am continuing as I write this."
"Long day, need to get more sleep. "
Studied for my upcoming tests.
Hung out with friends today after studying. 
Studied and reviewed lectures for tests tomorrow. 
I woke up early and wrote a test. I slept after and studied for my courses.

Also I worked today.
Really tired now.
Ate a lot after work."
"I have been able to get a fair bit of extra school done today because it did not take as long as I thought it would. It will make tomorrow much easier, since it is going to be a busy day. I am happy that I am working on drawing and painting more. I am in the right mindset that even though I am not happy with what I can do right now, I can put up with it while I practice. "
"Sabrina came home today! It was really good to see her. i always forget just how much fun it is to have the three of ours humor togeather! School was very tiring becuse I had a class this morning, then only did neroscience all the rest of the day...At least the work I did today will make tomorrow easyer."
"I drove all the way home from the camp gound today, 1 1/2 hour...I am so tired and have a head ach now, I just want to go to bed. After getting home I did some school, it was not the stuff I had planed (I had no brain power for science) but it is better then nothing. I would like to wirte more, but it is more important to go to sleep."
"I dont know what to say about today...it was a standered day. Though i did have one relization. My tuse/thursday classes are hard to focus on becasue I already know most of the stuff, but still need to pay attenchen to get the details and if there is anything she wants done diffrently from what I usually do."
"I got so much school done in such a short time! I even worked ahead a little. Since I got all my work done before lunch I went to the thrift store in the afternoon to look for insperation for my diorama...I did not find as much as I hoped for, but I have at least a few more ideas then before, though nothing compleat yet. I am so close to finishing the drag queen pupet, it is looking super good. Though unfortunatly the are wires are super bendy and not very good. I hope on the weekend I will has some time to work on my sewing projects outside of school, though I do need to get my aprin done first. I have really been enjoying drawing every morning. I am going to try adding in a short meditation and a little writing! "
"Busy but a good day...Class, lab, sewing my aprin and getting my new phone plan. I am suddenly feeling super motivated to get projects done. I do not know where the engery came from, but i am going to try and run with it!"
"I could not get motivated at all today! I did end up getting everything done that I needed to, but it was a push. I felt like I continued to run into a mental wall all day."
"I picked out some new reading glasses, it was really hard to find a pair that was even passible. I actually ended up getting mens! I hope when i get them home that they actually look ok when there is nothing else to compair them too."
"I am going to do a Christmas dance chorio/video for the studio. I will create it, teach it, and then people will send me videos of them doing it for me to edit together! I am really excited. I hope it turns out as good as it looks in my head! I feel like it need to get better at writing my feelings down, but it seams like i am putting something so personal into something inpersonal...it is something I will mentality  work on until I feel comfortable enough to do."
"The day started off a little sideways so I supcontousely wrote it off. Even though school went really fast, I was unable to get motivated enough to do much more."
"I have finished my last two assignments for THEA 1451! I just need to put the package in the mail, then I will officaly be done the course!!!! I am getting there :)"
"my fabric for becks christmas gift as shipped! there is a hope I will get it on time :) I really hope it looks good and is what I wanted, and she will like it!"
"I woke up late which made me feel like my day was not set up for success. However, I turned it around by being productive: I got all of my work done and had time to go on a walk outside."
"I really did not want to do my writing assignment, but after starting it, I felt more motivated to continue to work on it. In the future, I am going to try not to procrastinate and just start my work as soon as possible. Even if I don't get much of it done, simply starting it makes it much easier to make progress on it later."
I started my day by having brunch with my friend. This gave me the energy and mood boost to start my day right. I was productive for the rest of the day and used time-blocking to structure my work.
I took a break from the Q-Life because I was really busy with schoolwork. Today I returned to it and am happy that I did. I become more mindful after watching the videos and writing about my day so I am planning to do the Q-Life more consistently now.
"I feel well-rested after a good sleep yesterday. I am excited to begin reading week and de-stress, hang out with friends, and catch up on work."

"First time journaling online in a while. I usually have a journal of my own that I fill a few times a week, so Doing this is like extra help for organizing my thoughts. Looking forward to continuing this process. It helps to have professional insight into how to manage stress/work/social life/ well being. Excited to see whats ahead."
"Tough weekend, a lot of work, nothing seems to slow down, I'm comfortable in this environment, grinding every waking hour, getting a little closer every day. It takes time, I know that I'm still closer to the start line than to the finish, but that's fine. Just gotta keep grinding and soon enough (more like in a couple of years), the long days and the missed events/parties/hangouts will all be worth it "
"This weekend is one of those weekends that I consider the calm before the storm. Full of work to do, motivated to do work, and eager to start the journey against the tide that will come in the following days. Papers, midterms, tests, quizzes. I know what I must do and I am prepared to put in the time and work to do it because I know the benefits that the actions that I take now will have in the future."

"Messed up which first aid course I was supposed to take, essentially wasting my time and money. I now have to take another course at a later date which will end up just learning the same thing over again. Hopefully I'm even allowed to do this, as I was supposed to have it done before school even started"
"Woke up today after partying yesterday, had very little energy all day and didn't accomplish what I intended to for school. Not a terrible day because I don't mind too much that I didn't get stuff done today because I don't have much of anything that's super tight for time to do. Overall, a very average day."
"I came home from university today and saw my girlfriend, and played basketball in the really nice weather. A really good day overall"
"Did a lot of studying and work today. Got pretty caught up on my school work which takes a load off of how I was feeling about it.

Got to hang out with my girlfriend today which was as always very nice. Overall a pretty positive day. "

Looking forward to tommorow because I might play some hockey for the first time since the pandemic started."

Today I have a lot of work and a lot of studying to get done my Monday. I am also very concerned that I am going to fail a class
"This month has been very heavy with school work, due to this I haven't been able to get things done ahead of time so I'm working on big assignments that i only have 2-3 days before they're due. Trying to work through everything today and get a start"
"Feeling slightly overwhelmed with school lately. I have bee trying to Journal on my own but I'm finding it hard to take out the time to concentrate and do it. I also don't think that Journaling works for me, I don't usually feel any better after I write out my thoughts. I have a lot of school work do and not enough time to do it, I'm a transfer student so I am taking first, second, third and fourth year classes all at the same time. It's hard and none of my classes coordinate well together, usually when teachers know we have a big project due in one class they won't make a big project due that day for their class, but none of my teachers coordinate with each other so they don't know. I think I'm doing fine in all my classes besides one, online learning it really hard and I'm just overwhelmed"
"I got through a hard week of school and assignments, I still have a lot of work to do for next week, but I'm glad that I got through this week"
bad day. 
"parents are stressing me out more than school is, wish i could move out"
"I got through another tough week. I have a big paper and a midterm on Friday, I am working through it and making good progress, I feel slightly more calm and relaxed. I am just trying to do my best and be happy and focus on school, with also taking needed breaks and resting when needed. I am happy with my progress today, I am almost finished with my paper and I have an okay start on studying. "
"Just having a bad day, tired, didn't eat much, feeling very burnt out at this point in the semester. Very excited for the month off, my mental health needs it and my brain needs to decompress. Everytime I get through a ""hell week"" another one comes. I was getting ahead, I was doing a lot of work done, and then I look at the next two weeks and its more quizzes, and midterms, and long term papers, and labs, and formal reports, and other bullshit work. I am 5 years post secondary, I have worked my ass off and studied and did all my homework, passed my classes, worked hard, and guess what? I could not tell you one thing I learned first year, or second year, or third year. I work so hard to pass these classes for what? I can say I have not learned one thing, I have memorized lots, and then forget everything in a week once my midterm or exam is over. I've written lots of papers, but I am so crammed with other things and more work that 50% of my papers are bullshit that I pull out of my ass to hit the word or page count. I can say for a fact half my professors don't read my papers cause there is no way in hell I deserve As on them. I have learned how to talk in front of people and not care so much about what people think of me, I have grown up and learned some people skills and that stuff, but that also goes along with growing up I did not need to pay $50,000 over 5 years to learn that. I'm paying so much money to learn bullshit to get a degree that I probably won't be able to do anything with anyways, and then if I do get a job after I graduate nothing I have ""learned"" in classes is going to be any use to me. I looked at jobs and what I would need to do and I don't know how to do anything listed. But good fucking thing I know some bullshit about sodium potassium pumps, its really going to help me so much in life. Biology, Stats, Biomechanics, Anatomy (only half useful class even tho I forget half the shit) Chemistry, so glad I took all these classes really taught me how to pay taxes, and how to buy a house, how to invest my money, how to do anything that fucking matters. I am 22 and literally know nothing besides stupid shit that is not going to help me in any way shape or form. The only goddamn degree that is also going to half prepare you for the real word would be business and finance. If I could rewind 5 years I would say fuck science and do one of those two degrees. Science is pointless unless I want to go back to school for 2-4 more years, and by this journal entry thats an obvious no. I am sooooo happy my mental health and social life is absolute shit because I am drowning in pointless stupid school work that I am so fucking stressed out about. I can't wait to graduate and then let every young person know how fucking shitty it is, and to stay far away from science unless they're planning on doing med school, or something else along those lines. If not its all pointless :)"
Generally just not a happy person
"I had a pretty productive weekend, doing the daily log questions puts me in a bad mood cause it makes my productive weekend feel like I didn't do enough. Q-life isn't helping me"
just having the same shitty week I've been having for the last month. 
I have Journaling and I'm never happy 
I got most of my work done for this week. I failed a 24 page report that I worked on for 2 weeks so i'm pretty upset by that. I'm excited to take a break from school for the first time in forever this weekend. I need a break from my laptop so badly 
exams are coming up 
today was filled with constant go go go. I feel like I didn't really get time to breathe. I went from school to a conference to work. i cant even rest after work because of the homework I need to do. I feel like everything is piling up and I don't have time for anything. my motivation is not good lately I don't want to do much. and I haven't been exercising lately because I cant find the time during the day I feel like I don't have time for much else other than school and work. 
Today I completed a lot of homework and assignments and caught up on school. But more importantly I caught up on my personal stuff. I havnt put laundry away in a few weeks just being so over whelmed with school and work I would wash it but then it has just been sitting in the basket clean in the middle of my bedroom. Today I finally put it away as well as rearranged my clothes to remove the summer clothes and pull out some items I no longer wear to give away. I felt really good about myself after that little bit of productivity. And my room feel more neat and organized. It meakes me more calm not that itâ€™s neat. 
Today me and mom went out to the pop up shop with a bunch of local buisnesses and got some cookies and cheesecake from the local business. We also went to a new location store where I was able to find a Christmas gift for Lynn and one for mom. And theyâ€™re super cute. I really liked that shop. We got the Christmas tree up and even made a back drop of a fireplace for behind it. It was a really fun needed break from school and work stress 
"I had an early work shift this morning but couldn't fall asleep last night so I woke up tired. work wasn't too bad but during the lunch rush, everyone got on each other's nerves so that was stressful. Me and mom watched two episodes of the Mandalorian and that was a good part of my day. it was nice and relaxing. I accidentally fell asleep for a bit though when she went to cook supper but if I fell asleep it's because my body needed the rest. I got a good chunk of my german homework done after supper which helps with my stress. "
Today I was very productive. I got caught up in my nutrition course and I got some more of my German quizes done. Iâ€™m a bit upset with myself how far behind I let myself get in my courses but it has made me set a goal for next semester. I am going to get all of my assignments done before the due date I donâ€™t wanna be stressed and paniced with everything all the time and catching up for weeks of my work and notes. So I am going to satu on top of things. And when I do fall behind donâ€™t get into the mind set of Iâ€™m already behind Iâ€™ll just latch up on the weekend because thatâ€™s a lot of work. I also have been lacking in excercising and I know I need to do better than I have. I have only been doing about a 5 to 10 minute workout just somthing to get me out of my desk chair and moving a little bit because Iâ€™m so behind in classes itâ€™s hard to find time. So beginning over Christmas break I am going to begin working out regularly. This will also lead. Into next semester I will plan my days better and allow for time to exercise. With getting ahead on assignments Iâ€™ll have more time to myself to do things like exercise. 
Today I got a scholarship application done and submitted which I had planned to do today. I didnâ€™t get much other homework done after work as me and mom just say at the kitchen table amd relaxed and talked. I finally got my raise at work which feels good thoigh. Makes me feel appreciated. 
today i didnt get as much homewor as I hoped to get done as well I ended up eating too much when we went out to dinner. i had a very off and unproductive day and I wish it could have been more productive. as a result I am up later than I wanted trying to get things done that I should have already done. 
i was up late last night completing assignments and I couldn't sleep well because my shoulder and neck really hurt. today my shoulder an dneck were still bothering me and it mad it hard to focus and concentrate on work and school. as well everyone at work was on edge workers and customers included and it was hard to remain positive when everyone around you is being negative. i completed my german homework but i didn't not get to study much before my quiz tomorrow. tomorrow my goals after my KINE class are to get my notes caught up for the last week. i am not going to watch any tv until all my notes are done and i have reviewed a bit of my work as well as listened o some of the book that we are doing in class tomorrow. 
Today I was drained when I woke up I didnâ€™t sleep well I got to bed later and I didnâ€™t study much for my quiz. After my quiz and human phys class I made time to workout. I havnt been working out much lately and I know I should be and so today not only did a do a 20 minute exercise I also walked the dog with mom for half and hour. It felt really good to get out and like get fresh air and raise my heart seat a bit. As wel my new jeans finally came in and they fit really wel I mso happy. Tomorrow thomas is coming home and I canâ€™t wait to see him after supper. 
"Today after work I was very tired and had a really bad headache. Although Igor some review in for my exam tomorrow I probably could have done more. But instead I fell asleep by accident. Today we celebrated my, my sisters and pups birthdays so we had icecream cake as per my request. Thomas came home too so I finally got o see him which I was very excited about Iâ€™m glad heâ€™s home I missed Him "
I slept in way too long and this caused me to be more tired then if I had slept less. I ended up taking a nap today as well I was awake and alert after I had my nap. I wrote my psych exam and feel I did very well after my exam I went down stairs and wrapped some gifts and watched ghost whisperer. It was a relaxing night that I needed. 
"tired, a bit stress, okay"
"Today started off kind of rough and disorganized, I almost missed the start of my first class and that stressed me out and then the class gave me major anxiety when it came time for me to chime in and have input to the class discussion. Then I went to meal hall with my girlfriend and friends and it was nice to relax. When we got back to the res I was very high strung thinking about the future in respect to finding an apartment for my girlfriend and I and possibly needing to buy a car. when I got into the building I went upstairs to help my GF clean up our room before going to my room to catch up on my school work. oh and today I book a doctors appointment because my lower lumbar spine has been acting up again and I finally want to know what the final verdict is. as of right now i'm not feeling too  overwhelmed about everything because i feel like i am getting things done slowly but surely!"
Today has not been great but hoping tomorrow will be better
"Today I had way too much work to do and not enough time to do it. I haven't had time to talk to people in my circle, exercise or drink enough water. The day is not done yet I still have lots to do."
I slept in today and got on top of my work. I plan to drink lots of water later on and I hope to do well on my quizes tomorrow.
I killed 2 quizzes today and am all caught up on my school work! Life is good!
"Today I golfed, relaxed, and lived my values. I had energy and I am excited to see what tomorrow brings."
I had a productive day after a restful sleep last night. I exercised and got work done. Didn't quite finish all of it but that is ok.
I was tired because I didn't get enough sleep last night. it was a tough day but I manage to continue to work towards my vision.
I didnt get much sleep last night and woke up with no work ethic or motivation at all.
"I stayed on top of my classes today, worked out, and drank enough water so overall it was a pretty good day."
Today we the weekend before Thanksgiving and I am so excited for the long weekend. I am going to take a well-deserved break this weekend.
I had a pretty good day today however I have tremendous pain in my back and I can seem to figure out why. Once I figure out why I'll be having better days.
"I got off to a rough start today because my back was killing me!! After some stretching and breathing exercises, I was feeling a little better. I had a big breakfast and that really kickstarted my day. I was happy that I got a workout and enough hydration today."
I had a great day today and accomplished everything I set out to do this morning.
I got lots of sleep last night but still somehow still feel tired. Not quite sure why that is. I also exercise and got some homework done so that's good too.
Today was a slower day class wise so i caught up on my work and feel good about where im at in the midst of the first round of midterms.
today i woke up soooooo tired.  however i made the most of it and got a lot of studying done for my midterm at the end of the week.
I didnt get much sleep last night but I had a nap mid-day as well as a coffee and that gave me the energy I needed to be productive and get my exercise in.]
"I had a great relaxing Sunday today, playing golf and watching movies,  taking a break from the hustle and bustle of midterms. I have one more midterm tomorrow then I can fully relax until November. "
"I had a good day today. I am through the first round of midterms and got a great workout in. Now it is time for a restful sleep to recharge.
"
I had a good today. I stayed on top of my work and aced a pop quiz. I am enjoying doing these journals and reflect upon my day.
"I started to get caught up on school work. I had to drop a course this term because the workload was too high to keep up with as well as work, volunteer, and do my own physical activity. I did not want school to encompass my whole life this year, and it was going down that road. I am still a bit bummed about dropping the course, because it is one I do want to take, but life balance is more important, and also doing well in the courses that I am taking. My weekend coming up has a lot of work to get caught up on, so I will feel better when I feel ahead.  "
Joined a new gym and did groceries. Finished a lab 3 days early!
I had a very stressful day today. I overthought a lot and it didn't help the stress I felt at all. I wasn't confident in any of the tasks I performed and I just felt sad... My days are not normally like this and they're very rare.
Today I am able to work on what needs to get done while also taking some time away from my desk which has been really helpful. 
I began my day with a bitter mind because the previous week was really hard on me. But I was able to get things done and see how things are able to play out this week academic wise and life-wise. I have things outside of school planned for upcoming days and weeks that I am looking forward and that is my driving factor right now.
"My day was pretty good compared to previous days. I caught myself a lot today getting frustrated at small things when I shouldn't have. I got some good news yesterday which will make my days a little better in the future, so that is something to look forward to for tomorrow. It's just small things throughout the days that get my emotions to go high and I am trying to take them one at a time."
"I'm starting my day with a lot to do in this upcoming weekend school wise. It doesn't seem to end with the amount of work I need to get done. I'm trying to prepare by scheduling times outside of my room to take walks and go to the gym so I won't be sitting at my desk all day. I've been having trouble with overthinking and underappreciating the work I am doing on a daily basis. I focus sometimes on that one thing I didn't get done or when I did poorly on a quiz when I got all this other work done that I should be proud of. I'm trying to take steps back to see the bigger picture daily, and it's been hard, but it's a continuous battle that I want to take on. "
"I have had a rough night last night do to personal problems, and therefore felt like I didn't get a good start on my day. I am stressed about work and am feeling sad about leaving my family to go back to school "
"I am feeling more motivated to do work, and know that hard work will result in good things"
Today was stressful. I had two midterms and studied all day. I'm really hoping it pays off and that I can relax a bit next week 
"Today was an off day. I slept in and put off getting up to do school work. I felt I didn't want to leave my bed all day and I had no motivation to succeed. although I still did my lectures, I also wrote a midterm that had me feeling very discouraged. I am thinking that I will withdraw from that course because I will do better in my other courses, but this is making me feel like I am giving up because of laziness. I am trying to be positive about the decision I am making but I worry about the financial and mental stress that comes with it later on. I also spent today doing most of my school work, and I feel I am missing out on building relationships with my friends. I don't want to isolate myself from my friends, but I have a hard time staying focused if I join them. "
"I am feeling better about my day. In my last journal, I was really down on myself and upset with the life choices I was making. Reflecting on it today, I realize that life isn't perfect and there will always be bumps in the road. I need to stay focused on what my goals in life are while maintaining happiness. "
"Although I started my morning very tired because of staying up late, I felt very productive and had the energy to do the things I wanted to do. I went to a coffee shop with a friend whom I'm not close with, but want to be. I also did a good amount of work, and spent quality time with my roommates. "
"Today I wrote my physiology midterm, and am feeling very confident about how I did. I spent a lot of time studying and felt I knew a lot of the material that was covered on it. I did also get my marks back from my psychology midterm, and I felt I could've done better. I goal I have this week is to stay on top of my work and try not to slack, where this is a more calm week. Thursday my roommates and I are going to the city for Burger Week, and I am excited because we can get away from our stress and enjoy quality time together. My boyfriend is also visiting this weekend to so I have to be extra keen on making sure everything gets done. "
"I felt a little unproductive today, which is upsetting because I had such big plans to do what I needed in order to enjoy my weekend. I have been making up the work I didn't do earlier today, by doing it tonight, but I wish I could've had it done earlier. Tomorrow I cannot slack at all. If I can get all my work done tomorrow I will feel on top of my school work, and know that I am on track to being, not only a better student, but someone bettering themselves by achieving the goals I've set. "
"I think I accomplished everything I needed to do in order to enjoy the weekend. I may have slacked a bit with the timing, where I finished late and won't be getting a full 7 hours of sleep, but everything I set out to do was complete. I find myself comparing my progress with my roommate often though, where she's ahead of her schooling more than I am. I know we have different lives and tasks to do, and that I should just keep moving at my own pace as long as everything is getting done. "
"I wasn't as productive as I wish I was this weekend, but I did enjoy the things I did with my friends. We had a productive day in what we had planned, and had a great time bonding. This week however is quite stressful for me so I am feeling dissatisfied with myself that I didn't stay focused enough on school during the weekend. I was quite productive today though, and know that with hard work, I will be able to finish what's needed to be done, and giving enough effort to get a decent mark. "
"Yesterday was a really rough day for me. I didn't do school work on the weekend so I was really behind, and when I tried to catch up on Monday, it set me back for the goals I set in place for myself later on this week. I was sad and overwhelmed, and also having a disagreement with someone very close to me. I felt defeated and unmotivated, and frankly, wanted to give up. However I worked very hard last night, and even woke up early to shower and continue my work. I got a healthy breakfast and started today right. Although I was tired from only a few hours of sleep, I still had energy to do work, and I felt very successful. After supper I did begin to slack a bit, But after I am finished journaling I will finish the lectures needed today, and begin to assignments. "
Today I've got a large workload for school so I will be at my desk for most of the day
Ive got a test and a large assignment due tomorrow so I will be doing a lot of school work today but once my test and assignment are handed in I will be ordering pizza so I'm excited for that
I had to buy a new student id today because I lost mine for the second time. I'm glad I did though because now I can go to the gym again
lots of class and big need for studying
"wake up: 8:00am, got ready for spin, ate banana 
spin: 9:00 - 9:50am, forgot towel but had a good class (fav instructor Rob)
had class, it was a lecture and not interactive - i find it harder to focus in this class than others. ate yogurt and berries.
read 2 chapters of book for next class
laura and I had our class together at my place, ate crackers and cheese
it's ~3pm now, I'm planning on studying for my quiz tomorrow for the rest of the day and going to bed early. I had a good day; I love starting my day with spin class.

Went out last night and was out late, so I didn't sleep well
was very unproductive today (started module and brainstormed for a paper) and sleepy, but I ate well
then I met up with friends last night but was home by 10:45 (and picked up a slice of pizza on the way)

"oct 4
i went out with Alex, Dara, and Eleanor last night but got home by 10:30, so I was able to have a good sleep :)
I woke up early, and I worked on my linguistics assignment and phys lab report. 
I spent time with my family and dog.
I ate healthy food and drank lots of water and felt energized for my week.
Initially, I was feeling a bit overwhelmed about how much work I have to do this week, but I was really productive today so I'm feeling better. "
"oct 5
I slept well last night, and made myself a healthy breakfast.
I was really productive and accomplished more than I had expected, but i became anxious when thinking about a lab report I needed to write that is due on oct 7.
(i accidentally said that I was physically active on the last slide but I was not - i can't figure out how to go back and modify it. i kinda think it might be more helpful to write my journal entry and then fill out the previous page? not sure if that's an option though)
"
"tuesday, oct 6
i slept well last night and felt rested today!
I had a productive day and went to an evening spin class with laura. I'm a bit stressed because my week next week is super busy...I have a lot of family stuff this weekend, and I'm worried I won't be able to complete all of my studying/my paper."
"Oct 7
I had an awful sleep last night. My dog woke me up really early in the morning. 
On a positive note, I met my friend Cass for coffee before my 10am class. It was so nice to see her!! We were roommates, but she is doing her masters at Dal now so I miss seeing her all of the time. 
I'm a couple lectures behind in my phys class, so I'm stressed about catching up in that course. I just felt drained for most of the day, but I went to a yoga class at 5pm and meditated. I felt SO much better after that, and I had a productive evening. 
The day did not start off well, but it ended well. Highlight of the day was definitely seeing Cass!!"
"friday oct 9

Today, I studied more for my quiz when I woke up. Later in the day, I spoke to my co-op coordinator about possible funding sources for a potential co-op work placement this January. I met with a prof who had worked at Western in the area I would like to do a masters in this afternoon. I had a busy but fulfilling day! Unfortunately, I was not physically active. I'm excited to see my extended family this weekend. I really want to start spending more time outside, because fall is my favourite season. One of the things I miss most about in person class is walking to different buildings on campus between classes and enjoying the weather."
"Sunday, October 11
Today, I woke up early to go to a spin class with Laura. It was an awesome work out, and it was fun to have class with our favourite instructor! Then I drove to our family cottage and had an out door thanksgiving lunch with my moms extended family. The weather was amazing - it was so warm and sunny! My mom and I went to my uncles for dinner with my dads extended family, and it was exciting to see the little kids. I didn't do any studying today, but I wasn't planning to because I really just wanted to take some time off to focus on my family. family is really important to me, and I don't see everyone as much as I'd like. Overall, I had an awesome day and felt very lucky."
"monday, oct 12
I was pretty tired today, and I was not as productive as I had hoped. I am usually more productive when I exercise, so I should have gone for a walk or something. I'm trying to finish a paper that is due this Thursday, and I am finding it stressful. "
"tues oct 13
This week has been stressful so far, I've been trying to finish a paper/study for a quiz/figure out grad school applications that open on Thursday. I was not as productive as I'd hoped I would be, and I think part of that might be because I have been working at home and haven't been spending as much time exercising or being outside as usual. I'm looking forward to getting on track this weekend/next week which will be much less busy. I'm currently writing this reflection at 11:40pm on wednesday night and I never stay up late ever (like I aim to be in bed at 10) so this is an indicator of how disorganized/unproductive I've been lately"
"sunday, oct 18
i was really stressed about school/applying to grad school/figuring out co-op last week. i definitely find it harder to be productive now that all 5 of my classes are online, so I find it harder to reserve time to spend with my friends. I was able to hang out with my friends this weekend, and I'm feeling much better. Even though i still felt like i had a lot to do, i tried to be more compassionate towards myself. Feeling a lot better
went for a hike and the fall leaves were beautiful!!"
"Tues Oct 20:
Sadly, I have decided to stop going to spin classes after I read about all of the cases that were linked to Hamilton spinco. I'm going to try to find other ways to stay active; I think I might take up running. I also enjoy walking and yoga but I want to find a way to do more cardio, because I feel my best when I am doing cardio. I am super busy until next Tuesday, so I sort of feel like I'm  just in ""survival"" mode right now. I had a couple late nights on the weekend for the first time in awhile, and I always struggle to get my sleep schedule back after it is disrupted. I'm hoping I feel rested tomorrow, because I really need to be productive so I don't get stressed. I'm trying to listen to yoga/meditation podcasts while I get ready for bed because I find them soothing and help me disengage from everything else that is distracting me (school, work, social life, etc.)"
"Sunday, Oct 26
Today I did yoga with one of the SMILE participants who was in my group last year and we had a great time! I studied for my midterm on Monday too. Last week was very busy. I have been struggling to get into routine now that I have stopped going to work out classes (except for yoga classes). My grandmother is high risk for COVID-19, so i decided to stop going to the classes even though the risk is low right now as NS has very few cases. I have been using a spin bike in my house and trying to get outside a lot. "
"Oct 27
I have started to enjoy using a spin bike at my house. School/applications have started to become less busy which has been great. I finally feel like I am able to be more balanced in my day to day activities. "
"oct 28
I started off the day by going for a hike with my dog and my mom. It was so fun and i love seeing all of the fall leaves. I really enjoy being physically active in the morning. I spent the rest of the day studying for my midterm tomorrow. I had a virtual volunteer meeting for SMILE and then I had my virtual class. I don't enjoy being on my laptop that close to bedtime, but I found I was still able to fall asleep quickly!"
I was very stressed about my chemistry exam today and this morning I thought that I needed more practice. After finishing the exam I felt relieved and found it way easier than I thought it would be. I enjoyed a peaceful lunch outside afterwards. 
"Today was a bit more relaxed because I didn't have any pressing tasks. I spent most of the day getting caught up with lessons and notes, although I still feel as though I am behind. I took a longer break today by going to the thrift store, but I didn't find anything. Walking back, I stopped by the danish bakery where I bought some pastries, which I enjoyed.  "
"Today was a slower day, I mainly stayed at home, took care of chores, played piano, read a book. I made a goal to finish my psychology notes for this week's lesson, which I did successfully. I generally felt lethargic and not necessarily depressed but unmotivated. "
"Today I felt like I did nothing. I watched a lot of Netflix and I bought myself shoes. In terms of school, I managed to submit my math assignment, psych discussion and my post lab report. I still need to finish my pre-lab report and I wasn't able to study for my french quiz tomorrow, even though I know the material pretty well. I also wanted to get some bio notes done because the test is on tuesday and I'm worried I won't finish them tomorrow."
"I woke up very tired and stressed today because I had two quizzes to complete and I still needed to review material for one of those quizzes. I also signed up for a seminar but didn't think I would attend because of what I had to do today, my overall mood and my tiredness. I ended up doing the two quizzes and I got an excellent mark on both. I was even able to attend the webinar. Now I have the rest of the night off."
"It was a stressful day where I did some hard things. I set a boundary at work that I'm proud of. It was difficult to do, but I did it and I feel proud of it. I also connected with some dear friends. I was honest and authentic about my feelings and received the support that I needed. It felt good to be heard and supported."
Today I'm thankful for the sun shining brightly through the living room windwo. I'm thankful for time to do some laundry. I'm thankful for Eric stoking the furnace before going to work. I'm thankful for clarity on how to deal with my eyeglasses.
I spent some quality time with Eric this weekend. It felt good to reconnect and make some plans/learn some skills to strengthen our marriage.

Boring just studying 
I feel good because I was physically active today and it was a really good workout. Relationship stuff is stressing me out today. 
this morning was rough. the afternoon was really good. evening has been hard and disappointing as well as stressful. 
did a lot of studying today for my midterm tomorrow. I'm nervous for how that will go but I am trying to go into it with a positive mindset. last night I really shifted my focus and outlook on life from negative to positive so I am excited for this week and what it will bring. 
midterm went well today!
today I felt really tired when I woke up but then I had a good gym session and hung out with a friend I haven't seen in a while. there's a lot of things im excited for this week. 
today was a neutral day. I spent a lot of time on my computer watching lectures and doing school work. I did feel a little down today about some things unrelated to school. Im just not sure how to fix the thing im worrying about but I also don't want to fixate on it
had a fun time last night with my roommates and got to see my parents which was really nice. It was a good way to reset my mind and have fun and let loose.
feeling very neutral today. met up with some friends. I am a little stressed about school work. 
today was a neutral day. some personal things were bugging me. spending time with my roommates helped. Im nervous for my test on Friday
spent some time with friends. not sure if I should keep studying for my midterm tomorrow or just go to sleep. 
looking forward to getting a break and going home.  I don't have a lot of work today tonight because I got ahead so I'm excited for a chill night. 
spending time at home with family for reading week was really nice. feeling rejuvenated and ready to take on this next week at school. 
"Today was productive. I am a little stressed because next week is busy. I feel happy but just kind of stuck, like I just repeat the same day over and over again. "
" I woke up, did my morning devotions, completed schoolwork in the morning, then I went for a run, and in the afternoon I attended an online class and an online lab. I only had three breakdowns today, one in the morning and two in the afternoon. I started back on my anxiety medication two days ago after being off them for a few months. I don't think they're working. Loneliness is my constant companion, but I am glad to have roommates this year at school. I make sure I am busy throughout my whole day so I don't allow myself time to think about things that weigh on my heart; like school and my relationships. I am overwhelmed, but I will keep moving forward."
"I woke up, read my bible, washed the pile of dirty dishes on the counter, did homework until just after lunch, went for a long walk, worked on lab report, attended a lecture, worked on my lab report, now journalling, then bedtime. Today was a fine day, no breakdowns, no tears. I felt numb today though, I was just going through the motions. I did enjoy the quietness of my day, it didn't feel pressured or intense. The best part of my day was sitting in the living room with the sun beaming in while I read about the OT for one of my classes. I feel like I accomplished a lot today, and I practiced good time management. I promised myself I won't watch Netflix until the weekend and so far I have kept that promise!"
"I woke up way too early. Did an encouraging devotional. Made my family breakfast. Fed the horses. Did homework/completed an assignment. Took the dog for a walk. Went for a run. showered. Ate lunch. Did a little bit of school work. Drove back to wolfville. cried the whole way. went to lecture. watched a recorded lecture. did my q-life work. felt encouraged.

I'm upset with myself for not being real. for not being present. I'm always worrying and thinking about the next thing instead of the current thing. I want to be different, I want to be set apart but its such hard work. I am depleted of all resources. my tank is empty and I have no emotion or thoughts left. I'm empty. I want to be full."
"its been a long day, I logged some thoughts into my 'spontaneous journal' on my desk top. I'm learning a lot about how to help myself. I need to do the work, so that I can succeed. I have to accept that if I want the best for myself it is not going to come easy, I have to work hard at it. I have to work diligently. "
"It's been a long day. I got so much done, but it seems like my list of things to do for school is never ending. It won't ever end until I graduate. I never feel like I've come out on top, I only ever feel like I've come up just enough for one breath of air and then I have to go back down into this sea of schoolwork again. I've never wanted to give up on school more than I do right now. But I won't. I'm too committed to this degree. It's extremely hard work to get to the other side. But the joy that I will feel when I get there!!!"
"The day started off great, I watched a sermon, read a book for school, went for a run, had a healthy breakfast and lunch... but by the time 2:00pm hit my motivation dropped off a cliff. I felt immobilized and sat watching Netflix, feeling guilty about needing to accomplish more, get more done, be ahead not behind. Pull your shit together, brush it off. Stop blaming your failure on your mental health and start taking responsibility for your laziness. I'm wiped right out. But the saving grace of my day was when Julia reached out to me and laid everything out that had been a burden from her week. This gave me the confidence to talk about all the garbage thats floating around in my mind, weighing me down like a rock in a lake. Where are you God? I don't feel your presence. I feel like I'm failing in my faith and so it has made you leave my side. There's gotta be something more."
"I got a few things done this morning, an assignment and a lecture, sent out some emails. But today felt bright. it felt good to be alive, and I didn't feel overwhelmed today. I'm ending my day feeling proud of myself for sticking to my plan of what I wanted to accomplish. I didn't exercise today, but my mind feels clean. It might be because of the great convo me and Julia had yesterday, but I think my positive mindset today made me feel at ease. it was nice to be home alone so I could just feel comfortable in my own skin and not monitor everything I'm doing so as not to be weird or in the way. that's all for today "
"The past week has been stressful as I spent the entire time at home with the family. But today was great, I had alone time, I accomplished my schoolwork and I had quality time with Jesus. We worked through some very tough things today but I know that all the pain of growing that I'm going through right now will be worth it in the end."
"I've been wrestling with how to get rid of 'the great sadness' that follows me around like a dark cloud over my head. and the q-life and some other resources have answered this for me; it starts with gratitude. I was listening to a song and it made me think of how I need to happy in the here and now, I need to be happy with the gifts I've been given, I need to be happy with what I have and not long for what I don't have. I feel lighter that I don't want to let depression rule my life anymore. I can't just get rid of my sadness overnight, but I can work toward gaining control over it and being the master of my thoughts, not letting them define me. I can do this"
"my day was very productive in relation to schoolwork, but I'm still dragging my feet on one assignment. I called my mom today, it was a good call but I hate that she wants to talk about everyone else so much. I don't care, and I don't want to gossip. this is a really hard habit I am trying to break with her. I also don't want to be vulnerable and tell her everything that is on my mind because she can't keep it to herself. she used to be a trustworthy person but now she has turned into someone else. I don't have super big secrets to hide but some things don't need to leave her mouth. I did well to not talk too much about the boys as it isn't her business. I am very proud of myself for that. they are living their life and I am living mine. we are intertwined but not the same and not everything needs to be shared. she needs to stop looking at Mali like he's some project she's trying to fix. let God work in his life and heal him she doesn't need to always intercede.
Im worried about my brothers moving to Ontario. I'm so scared they will get sick or get stuck there and I won't see them for a very long time.
I'm so tired its almost killing me. I'm finding it hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I need rest and it is going to be so hard to rest when I go home at Christmas. Father I pray you prepare me for going home so that I can properly rest and prepare myself for next semester."
"I wrote an exam, finished an assignment, went for a long walk, and made healthful meals. I'm exhausted because of some bad news I received this weekend about injuries both in my family and about old friends. I am very worried for all of their health."
Going to be a great day!
I am taking a mental health day from studying and I have a BBQ with my family today which I am very excited about :)
Today is a good day :)
"I am trying to catch up on school work, I feel extremely overwhlemed"
I am planning on trying to catch up on University work
I feel that today I did not accomplish much academically 
"I finally got my much needed sleep, after my midterm filled week"
"Productive. Got baking needs figured out, made credit card application, got 90 minutes of physical activity and worked"
Today we signed a lease! super excited about that and it was a huge stress reliever to get that over with lol i woke up today feeling blah and i didnt even exercise i was just feeling so unmotivated. i think im going to be a fisherman for halloween so thats kinda fun. im booked a appointment with the consellor because i actually think im depressed its bad. i have zero motivation for anything i need to swim. i am just so sad all the time ugggg i have zero motivation for school and my grades are just not good. i need help i want this semseter to be over ahhhh anyways tmr is halloween so hopefully it will be good i dont even really want to go out but im going to it might be fun 
"Tired but optimistic, grey day outside, going for walk with friend after school work is done"
"Just down, some hard stuff going on"
My day was very busy today 
"Nothing, study day"
Normal study day
Happy and finish all my work
"I got a really bad sleep last night and woke up feeling so tired and sick to my stomach, I woke up bloated out of stress. I wanted to start my day at 8am but only got out of bed at 9am and to the library at 10am. It was a fairly productive day but I still didnt actually get anything done becuz I have so much to do that I am so behind. I feel like im losing hope like im pushing myself into a corner with school and need to give up. I have 3 things that are a week late that I cant even start cause im trying to keep up with everything else. Im so tired and I hate that I dont have time to exercise at all and I just want to feel good and healthy and keep up with school."
"Very busy day and was productive all day. Still the issue though that even though im productive majority of the time I have too much to do. But also considering that im taking 4 hours off tonight to celebrate Alishas birthday. But to me these friendship things are an immediate priority, im not going to not do something because of school. I woke up relatively close to when I was supposed to and early, 7am. I didnt feel great when I woke up but I got right to task and set up alisha bday. It was really nice getting to wake her up and give her presents. I then had a 3 hour class, finished the assignment, and I told the prof about the issues in the group which made me feel better. Still absolutely hate them. Also I still need to write the lit review ahhh. I then had to finish my math assignment. that took 2 hours. I am proud that I decide to not copy things down I dont understand even though it negatively effects my mark. But it is what it is. Then I studied and wrote my midterm, I got an 80 which is good for the little time I spent. I will now get ready for the night, clean my room, then use any other time before 7pm to look at the lit review. then 7pm on is alisha birthday time.

I have so much to do but I hope I can catch up eventually. I will try to be productive all day tomorrow. I will plan out my schedule tonight. My goal for tomorrow is to finish my lit review, taking breaks by editing the survey, and then worry about theory.

Felt tired all day but manageable."
"I have made my lists and prioritized the rest of the semester.
I feel a bit overwhelmed with the amount of work in one of my courses, but think a more defined plan will make it feel more manageable.
"
"Today was an emotional day. I have been stressed balancing School work, Coordinator duties i.e. event planning & taking care of myself. My emotions were kinda everywhere this morning. Yet, I decided to go for a walk because it's a tool I have that I know will ""re-set"" and ground me from being restless. During the walk, some sad emotions arose because today was the birthday of a former partner that still carries painful memories. When I started to reminisce about them and the happy memories we had, I shut them down by telling myself that "" Those are not the only happy memories you will have with someone:  it was a stepping stone, not your final destination"" You will see the sunrise again "
"Today was stressful. I am home with my parents for the holidays. It is tough because my parents are constantly fighting and yelling. I wish I didn't come home over the holidays because even when I ask them to stop, they keep yelling or pick immature fights with each other. 

Luckily, I got in the habit of doing some off-site journaling to help me prepare to go home by practizing setting boundaries with my family members. "
"I have two midterms today, ARDA and O chem. That fucking sucks. I am dealing with the residual emotions from my fight with Alex this weekend at the Halloween party. and I am also dealing with my emotions regarding Kim, Bob, and Evan and what went down when I and Alex were at the farm. I am financially stressed and don't have the money that I spent on tires and I am anxious about having that convo with Kim."
"A lot has happened in the last couple days, and its starting to impact my mood. My ex texted me yesterday, seemingly angry that I ""dropped him instantly"" for cheating on me over 7 months ago now. I haven't responded to him in months, and he still sends me these pathetic texts periodically despite the fact that I asked him to stop speaking to me. He also owes me money, and I'm stressed about my financial situation, but its not worth the panic attacks I get every time he tries to talk to me (and I can't see him ever paying me). I blocked his number so he can no longer contact me, and I feel better about that. In addition, today, student loans took money from my account despite my still being in school and I recently had a large expense for my car. I'm also currently sick and waiting on results of a COVID test, so today all around isn't the best, but hopefully tomorrow will be better. Positives in my life: I have a wonderful and caring partner who has been extremely supportive through everything, I'm quarantining with my roommate who I love spending time with (even when we're grumpy), and I submitted a big grant application yesterday that has been a big time commitment. "
Stayed up way too late on my phone which made me sleep in past my alarm. I planned to get through a bunch of lectures I am behind on but since i slept in I didnt start as early as I wanted to. Then my friend asked me to drive her to a doctors appointment so of course I did. I was glad to help her out but this also delayed my homework start even further so I didn't really get to working on school work until about 4PM. I also did not eat regular meals today so I was feeling hungry. My energy levels were low so when I was doing school work I was not able to focus well.
"Today has been interesting. My Wednesdays are busy in terms of classes but in the morning I like to wake up early before the first class of the day to give myself time to really become alert and ready for the day. I enjoyed seeing the sun shine and melting the snow of the day before. I knew today was going to be difficult as a soccer fan and my team unfortunately lost but I got over it already. My school work was kinda boring, especially the philosophy. I could barely hear the 1984 clip he played and when I got the the business course at 7:30 I was taped out and thankfully I got to go to the gym to get some frustration out. I also had a fantastic dinner made by my mom (she really kills the spaghetti I gotta say). Did chest at the gym saw some people from highschool that I really didn't want to see, but they eventually came up to me before I said anything. It was a short convo and the gym experience was odd and crowded. I finished my workout and had a nice relaxing night watching soccer highlights from better teams than my own and did some of the activities I had for the Q-Life site. I enjoy the journaling because it helps to highlight what was accomplished during the day. I also go my background check stuff done for my new job! Can't wait to make some big money again. I think it is time to head off to bed. A day in the books and I feel happier than usual. 
 "
"Today was a day where I took a day off from the gym so I did not really move around much at all until I had to go to work, but even there I just really stand around for the most part waiting for customers. I had a shift at nslc and I think it was good for my mental health to have some brief conversations with customers and get a hold of my emotions. I got frustrated at the start of it because I was getting made fun of for not knowing how to use the calculator in the employee office very well. I was proud of myself because I didn't let it stay in my head. I quickly got over it and actually did well as the shift went on. Felt accomplished afterwards, my memory was failing me a bit with employee numbers and such but that will come with time. 

Other than the shift at nslc I did not do much. Did a short quiz in my history class where I had to watch a film, and it was easy. Glad to have a friend in the course who I can ask questions and get answers from. Professors must hate this time. Constant cheating from students and lack of engagement would be awful to deal with. People were already struggling to get interested with course material in person, but now the uninterested person could just turn their camera off and sleep if they wanted to. A weird time and a frustrating one. 

I saw a classic movie called goodfellas on tv and I love that feeling watching an old movie gives you. I think I will ask more people about their general interests at work in the future. Good way to get to know people really and helps to open up about your own to try and get some common ground established. I really do think I am feeling happier recently. This journaling helps a lot and I have to remember I am not the person I was before. Change is ok, change is sometimes needed and the changes I am making are what I am most proud of. Life is too short to regret things. The people who make fun of me will likely forget me soon enough. And I too will forget them with my horrible memory ahahah. I shouldn't really talk about myself like that, but I feel like the self deprecation is ok to acknowledge faults that I can then correct later. 

Anyway time to play some star wars video games. Then bed."
"Today was a frustrating day to say the least. I wish I was a little more in control of myself the night before, but the hangover was not even present this morning thankfully. The drive home was calming and helped to get myself excited for the day (Graduation is a quality album to listen to when you want to get energy levels up). 

After some paninis I went off to work and my shift started off poorly with the news our debit machine were down. After seeing the prettiest girl working with me on a slow sunday I figured I would have a great shift on my hands, unfortunately it was going to be a day in which my confidence would be killed. I got to get to know her a bit and I only stumbled on my words like twice... Honestly the debit machines were fixed quickly and we had a decently slow start to the day, but I just felt sort of lost and confused whenever I was standing at the front of the store alone. I wanted to help more, but I was not sure when to jump over. 

This uneasiness wasn't as frustrating as the counting at the end of my shift. I can't stand having someone look over my shoulder while I do something. I also think I do not handle authority figures very well. I stress myself out way too much when it comes to whoever I am a subordinate to. I don't even like to say certain things because of this fear of having them hate me or think I am stupid. Making mistakes in front of my boss is something I fear the most in every job I have ever had. I feel like I am so stressed whenever I know they are watching and I overthink it 9/10 times which makes me mess up. I realized today that I need to really reflect over all the negative thoughts I have like this because it helps my brain understand the problem and I realize how silly it is to think that way. Just because someone sees one mistake doesn't mean they will hate me. Even the best make the mistakes at work and thats a part of life. I wrote down my tasks how they are supposed to be done so that I can do them better next time and I will try to block out those negative thoughts when I am counting or I am dealing with any task at work for now on. 

After I got home I did my q life activities and it really helped me analyze the problem. I am going to be more self compassionate and I will appreciate the things I do right over thinking about the few things I did wrong more now. To celebrate this realization I played a game of scrabble with my mom and decided to spend time catching up on the premier league matches I missed today. Now it is time to play some star wars video games before bed. I think today was a fantastic learning opportunity.  "
"I started today by hearing my mom wake me up to let me know that I had a gym appointment still. I completely forgot about it when setting my alarm, so I quickly got up and got ready to workout. I made a latte with my nescafe coffee and I was ready to roll. 

Got to the gym and went in only to quickly be asked if I had a mask. After going back to my car and getting it I began to get ready for my back workout. I did all the old exercises I used to do for the most part with a lot less weight, but it felt great to be lifting weights again. 

After listening to my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and going around the gym singing kanye songs under my breath I went home and got some breakfast and then got ready for my history course. This part of my day was easy and I got thru it with ease. Enjoying the panini and writing down all the different ww1 notes. My other course was boring and my mock interview went well, but nothing spectacular to talk about with either of those things. 

I also watched an episode of one of my fav shows currently which is Cobra Kai and I remembered how amazing it was. I thought to myself, ""why did I stop watching this if there was another season???"". My day was honestly forgettable other than the dnd sesh I had with my friends after my mock interview. Got through that and then started reading up about the different spells my character had access to. Now I am gonna either talk with my buddy before bed or just play my star wars game again. I can't wait to visit my friend in New Brunswick on Wednesday. It should be a good trip and I think it will be worth the drive for sure.  "
"First day back journaling for the first time in a bit. Took a break while I was in NB because I was more focused on drinking and hanging out with friends. I think this is something I could definitely get done even when I have a night where I go drinking. Instead of doing the writing while I am drunk I can do the writing the morning after and try to remember all the different things I do throughout the day. I am gonna do this next time I am going out. I drank waaaay too much I think, but it is not something I do a lot anymore so I don't really regret anything. 

I had a pretty fun trip, but it felt uncomfortable at times for sure. The sleeping situation for example was brutal because I had to sleep on a leather couch which my bare skin stuck to and the floor the second night. It was warm at my friends place and it was a struggle to sleep because of it, but I got through it in the end. I also found it awkward trying to talk to Nathan at times and his girlfriend. I never found it too difficult to talk to him at Acadia, but now I really don't have a lot in common with him so I struggled to make any conversation with him and I was self conscious about the things I was saying. I felt dumb every time I opened my mouth and I can barely hear him when he talks because he speaks quietly and I just hate making people repeat themselves. I enjoyed the games we played when we were drinking, but the NBA games frustrated me A LOT. Basketball is a game I find that is very difficult to maintain consistency in especially in the video game form. I simply don't have the knowledge about the sport as well which contributes to a lot of my misery with it all. I feel like everyone I know is into it, but I just can't seem to get invested in it for long enough to really learn a lot about it. Surface level stuff is what I know and everyone is a fucking expert on the shit. Maybe I will look into it but honestly during school I do not wanna focus on it. 

Soccer >>>  

If I was in England I would prefer the soccer conversations a lot more because I know far more about the sport in comparison. Even then I need to really dive into history and try to remember more information surrounding my interests to have better conversations. I always feel like a simpleton when I speak about my favourite stuff and it is something I wanna change so that I don't have the feeling I did at Nathans. Easy change for sure.

My memory frustrates me a lot, and I wanna work on it to improve my conversation ability. I think I also wanna just be better at being funny. I am not sure how I can work on this, but I will look into it in the coming weeks so I am not the quiet mute boy every time I am at social events. I obsess over my word choice in social situations sometimes, like when I said ""when exiting"" to nathans girlfriend describing the situation where a guy was asking us about what we were doing with all the drinks. I think I really stress the small things and I will be working on this in future experiences for sure. I enjoyed the drive with Theo, but man that guy loves his podcasts. I don't see the appeal really, just a bunch of random people who don't have a background in anything in particular talking about their ordinary lives. They have funny moments, but overall I don't remember the jokes almost ever so I am starting to think his favourite podcasts aren't worth the time it takes to listen. It sucks because his time consists largely of podcast listening and I struggle to relate with that... Him and Nate try to get me to listen, but I should just say I don't enjoy their content. I feel like podcasts are good for lonely people and maybe it replaces that conversation we don't have as much nowadays during the pandemic. 

This little vacay made me realize how little I knew about things I am slightly interested in. I don't wanna focus this journal about too much more negativity because I was at peak negative Dave on the lonely car ride back to sackville. I had to write about the experience because I think it was eye opening. I wanna make a change because of the experience and this is me explaining that. 

Today was a fantastic change. Got up early and I am starting to get into the habit of early gym workouts. Cardio and the gym still get me all itchy which is extremely annoying, but I have to keep this gain train moving ahead on the path to the six pack. Thats my big goal for this coming summer. The new future and uzi album was great for the gym and I enjoyed listening to it during my intense cardio sesh. Great for the car ride home as well. 

I got home got into my routine and watched some cobra kai. Unfortunately I am almost done the second season. I can't wait for the third one and I think it will be a fantastic experience for the fans of the show if they continue to develop Johnny's character. I think it will likely try to rebuild him and his sons relationship, just a prediction. I think its a logical step and I am not sure how it will happen, but I can sense thats the move for the writers. I hope the show isn't dragged out, but it could end up going that way if it gets more popular. 

Other than that I worked on myself and the Q-Life stuff I was lagging behind on. I think I have a good grasp on what I value now and my vision for the future. I sense a lot of traveling in my future once this pandemic is over. Likely with the guys I was closer with in residence. I value their friendships a lot and it was so awesome to speak with Mark and Alex on video chat today. Made me really happy to hear from them and have some classic jokes said. 

Other than that I worked on my history of rock stuff today and just got a plan together for the week ahead in terms of school. Lots of work likely coming these next couple weeks. Close to the finish now and it is only going to unfortunately get colder. My hatred for winter rivals the hatred Anakin has for sand I would say. I can't wait to start driving the SUV my dad used to drive. 2021 is going to be quite the upgrade I think. I am surprisingly looking forward to things now.  "
"Chill sunday full of things I love. Finished cobra kai, ate homecooked food, listened to podcasts from Joe Budden and played video games with friends. Also spoke about a business idea I have in the works and began work on the research aspect of the business. Not too much happened that I need to really deep dive into today. 

I think I am going to just keep being the positive force in my life from now on. The positive voice is overpowering the negative one in my mind and now I can see myself looking at the challenges in life as less daunting tasks/problems. I think this week will be an extremely productive one and I will likely be trying to finish school work in advance while I have less shifts. I am slightly becoming more nervous about the pandemic and the numbers rising here, but I am praying every night that the curve flattens once again before the vaccine is even needed. 

The week ahead brings me another mountain to climb and I will be on its summit before long. 
"
"Today was pretty excited in terms of the business I am looking at starting regarding the vegan lifestyle. I posted on a few different facebook groups to gather some research and I now have a few meetings set with different people that I spoke with online. This week is going to be probably a little busy and thankfully I do not work too much. I predict I will probably get a couple shifts at bell however and I hope I don't have to worry about any covid scares. If I even slightly feel like I am getting symptoms I will be staying home, same if they announce something was exposed at the mall.

Other than setting up the meetings I attended all my classes today and paid attention in two of them. I am starting to get frustrated with my philosophy course again because I find it is literally the most pretentious thing I have ever experienced at university. At this point I just want to pass because I feel like it is almost impossible to get an A in it. Perhaps I can really pull out a good essay on 1984 and raise my average, but with the big brain Paul Abela marking, I would have to literally provide an essay answer that he has never considered before to even get close to an A. 

Other than school and the vegan thing my day consisted of an amazing shoulder workout in which I did a lot of my favourite exercises I used to do with Mark. The only one I left out was the overhead press I used to do with a barbell. Next time I will likely incorporate that into my routine, but I do not feel like it is a necessity. I will likely aim to get closer to what I was pushing in terms of weights next week. Gotta keep amping up the gains by pushing the bigger weights. Then my chad energy will be maximized. Jk, but I am excited to start looking bigger again. It really does raise my confidence seeing my muscles in the mirror plus I just feel healthier now. If they close the gyms again I will literally consider buying a couple sets of weights and a couple different benches and maybe a squat rack. Please god let me keep going on this gain train.

Ended the day with some quality time with the fellas and played some star wars HVV. Honestly that game makes me so happy to play again. Its like an adrenaline shot of nostalgia. I think they really executed the updates well on that game and I hope they can keep doing well with these new star wars games. If my friends were interested in the new star wars: squadrons game I would have probably copped instantly. Need more star wars content in my life. I think I will be binging the mandalorian tomorrow as well. Ugh I might just try disney plus for a bit who knows... 

Fuck I have to buy something for my moms birthday. I am an int. I will look for something while I am at the mall I guess for work. Maybe I could bring home a bunch of tickets or find something in the mall that she would love. Problem is she doesn't have many interests... FUCK. I am sure an idea will come to me thats better than buying her a bunch of lotto tickets.

Maybe the idea will surprise me in a dream and I will somehow remember it, but the odds of that happening are lower than seeing Trump actually get back into office. FML. Not actually a huge deal but next time I gotta actually plan something out.

"Today I am thankful for my friends who were kind enough to listen to me when I had a problem. I am also thankful for the open community I joined and how honest this women was about her vegan life. I am also thankful for the amazing food my mom can make and how tasty it was. I completed a bunch of Q life activities I had piling up here on the site and it felt so amazing to complete them all. I could have spent time working on school activities, but I have time to get that done tomorrow. I am excited to see how my second shift goes tomorrow at Bell speaking of tomorrow! I hope I get a chance to talk with some of the pretty girls I work with. Hopefully I can make something happen with one of them, but I gotta find out if they are single.

I didn't journal yesterday and I wanted to highlight the awesome experience I had with an old friend from university. Speaking with him made me realize that I could have spent far more time hanging with different groups at Acadia and I likely would have had such a different experience if I had done so. I do not think I regret it, but it is interesting to think about. My friend Yash was showing me all these cool horror short movies and also these Buzzfeed unsolved videos which funnily enough my sister was watching the other night. I loved the content and I think I am going to try and check it out once I get some more free time. Speaking with Yash is always worth it because I learn something interesting from him. Whether it be selling stocks, careers moves that are smart (real estate for him) or just cool horror movie content I should check out. He is such a genuine person and I am glad I ended up working with him all the way back in my second year at Acadia. 

I realized that I am in need of a girl friend and I have been trying to really make a push to meet more people even with the rising cases trying to hold back my love life. Today I have been chatting with a few more girls and it has been going well. The girls I have been talking with have also been showing signs that things are going well. Hopefully I can have a proper facebook officially gf before the end of 2021 at least. Only time will tell. 

I also had a killer workout today and I think I will be back to the weights I was moving very soon. The new King Von album was amazing and I also revisited the future and lil uzi album as well. Definitely some great music being released right at the tail end of this year. Lots of stuff to look forward to and I do not wanna make this super long, but today really was amazing. Even the disagreements I had today were productive in my GC. I really would rather have a public transport centered city compared to having to sit in traffic, but it was interesting to hear where Andrew was coming from. I also got great news that my expense to my former landlord will be lowered because the guy who broke the shower is gonna fork over some cash to help pay for things. All in all today has been quite the change in terms of my overall mood. Not even my friends roasting me for not listening to their podcast bothered me much. Their words did not affect me once I spoke with other people I knew about it. At the end of the day if I am not interested in something I am not going to force myself to enjoy it.

Anyway I think I am gonna try to get to sleep sooner so that I get a goodnights rest before my shift tomorrow. "
"I really had a solid day apart from being able to work out. I should start going for walks after or before my shifts on the days that I do not have time to go to the gym. 

-I am thankful for the classes I have chosen this semester (at least for history of rock)
-I am thankful for the people I have continued to speak with regarding veganism
-I am thankful I am able to speak with friends and provide support when they need it

Today wasn't exactly super eventful due to a work shift. I am excited to be able to sell phones again and have a chance to make more money at Bell. I did not let my emotions get the better of me today and I was making good conversation instead of sinking into my shell and being scared to speak. I even tried making more jokes than I normally do without looking anything up beforehand, but I definitely will start doing that...

Other than that I didn't do much today. I have been obsessing over certain aspects again, but I guess its more balanced now. Just need to make sure those things do not dominate my thoughts. Balance is key.

I have done some great work regarding my history of rock journal and I will likely complete it tomorrow, if not tonight. I should have probably reviewed my ww1, but I am not overly concerned about it. If I have Anthony to work with things will be fine. I will definitely be able to get over an 80 again considering I almost always pay attention in that course now. 

I have things in order and I feel a lot better every day in comparison with how I was feeling a couple of weeks back. Need to dive deeper into my thoughts however. I want to understand the world better and I will make it my mission to do this for the rest of 2020 and carry that energy into 2021. I see a few mountains I need to climb.
"
"- I am thankful for being able to reflect after the more difficult days
- I am thankful for the friends that check in on me
- I am thankful I have technology capable to make me more intelligent 

Today was a day in which I started off with a good amount of sleep. I haven't been journaling or logging because I was with friends the night previous and I forgot to log in and get my things sorted on here before I left for work. I am back now and happier for it. I have been realizing that I am stretching myself too thin in terms of my social life. I need to draw back and realize that its ok to say no to people. I would have gotten way more done today if I just said no. Today was difficult at times because of the thoughts going through my head regarding my dnd friends again (I hate typing that but its easier) and also my thoughts about my dad and how he interacts with my mom and sister. 

I think a lot of my stress with communication stems from my families poor communication amongst one another. It feels like we are all at our happiest when we are separated which is depressing to think about. I find trying to talk with my family can be awkward and I struggle with the emotions I have towards them or the lack thereof. I feel empty around them and I almost wish that time would go by quicker when I am around them. I then regret this thought and afterwards feel guilty about it. Time is precious and should not be wished away. I will continue to work on this and communication in general. That is one of my biggest goals for the new year. I will be looking to improve my communication ability tenfold.

Other than that car ride with dad today was relaxing. Got to watch some soccer, walk the dog, and review things about my vegan project for business. I need to organize my essay this week big time, and I will look to do that this week. I am falling behind in my philosophy big time, but I can catch up this week for sure. Other than that I am going to start going for more walks because it helps to clear my head when I am stressed/frustrated. Plus the dog definitely appreciates it.    "
"Today I got the news that we were hit with 11 new cases of covid 19. I knew that if cases kept rising that I would be risking living at home cheaply with my parents and I now think I should have never applied to get the jobs I have currently. I am frustrated and I feel trapped. The thing is, I know quitting these jobs is the right thing to do, but it does not ease the pain like it should. I see judgement all around me with every move I make and the emotions are being felt with the stares. I am scared. I believe there is a bigger game at play here and I don't think we the general public will ever really understand it. 

I cannot change that and I should not worry about it. For now I must focus on school and my mental health. Eventually I will be able to make my vision for the future a reality, but for now I will continue to stay vigilant and away from crowds and public spaces. I truly think today could have been more productive than it has been. Other than attending classes I did not do much other than hit the gym eat and watching content. The soccer games were enjoyable and the youtube videos I watched were distracting, but I wish I could escape this world we live in and live the way I dream of. 

I am scared shitless and I hope the future is brighter than the dark world I see around me. The rain could not have picked a worse time to add to my negativity. Tomorrow I will look to start my essay. I think I will be more productive tomorrow. I might also look at ordering something to workout at home easier. I want to avoid the gym and any public interaction once again. This second wave is unfortunately upon us.  "
"- I am grateful for being more positive now than ever before
- I am grateful for having friends who listen to my problems
- I am grateful to be able to read and comprehend serious topics and books

I started today wondering what my future would look like and I think now I am feeling ok with the decision I made to quit my job at Bell. I am going to be doing the same at my other job because of this pandemic and the rising cases here. For now I will make it a personal goal of mine to find a job where I can work from home and then hopefully find something more conventional when this pandemic is over. 

Hope is something that is hard to come by but I think if you have a positive group around you and you shield yourself from the negative thoughts present in your mind then success can be found. It really is that simple and then you can truly plan better than if you were constantly living with stress, negativity and fear. I know what I want to do and I know I can accomplish it. I even made this daunting 40% essay seem like a walk in the park. Thank god its on a book I love.

Other than the essay summaries I have been watching, I have also been relaxing for the majority of today. I started the day watching karate kid and this was a positive way to kick things off after I emailed my boss saying I quit. He also told me I could get rehired in the future so there was a huge boost to my day. In addition to watching the karate kid I also took the dog for a walk while I waited for class to begin. Listening to a few songs from the psychedelic chapter of my history of rock class. I turned on the soccer game afterwards and ate while I waited for my class to begin.

I enjoyed the class today because it reminded me to always try to look deeper at things. Especially music. I think my prof hates surface level thinking judging from how much he hammers on about us not diving deep in our previous assignments. This is something I do respect and I believe he is trying to have us actually learn valuable life skills. It reminds me of the work Mrs Engram used to do at SHS. Making connections was the point he really hammered on about today and said mindless memorization is useless. The lesson and assignment that taught it really opened my eyes and helped me understand where he was coming from. I also respected him a lot more after todays class. 

Other than this I saw the huge covid numbers on the news and realized I made the right decision. Other jobs will be found after this weird time. Things will slowly change for the better, and I have to remain positive and hopeful for this brighter future. The goals are changed, but the vision remains the same. Anyway time to relax before bed and take it easy while I listen to some more psychedelic rock.  "
"Today was a chill day. I got to go see the car I am going to buy and it has really low mileage. The only downsides were no cruise control and manual windows, but the windows are better for winter time when things get frozen. It feels exactly the same as my car that I have minus the constant violent shaking from the engine. Definitely a worthwhile purchase and my aunts are going to buy it for me for graduation. 

Other than that I spent most of my day reading writing and attending lectures. The only thing that I did that deviated from those activities was when I was looking at some footy analysis from statman dave on twitch and YouTube. I also worked out briefly today by doing pushups and this did not hit as hard as a full workout at the gym, but at least I did something. This weekend I will workout a plan for different muscle groups so that I can still get some muscle growth. I might even invest in weights with my last paycheques from work.

Classic rock and roll is the best! I had some amazing class time going over different artists like led zep, deep purple, the yardbirds, and many other artists and I think it was awesome to hear the different live performances especially the led zep performance of dazed and confused which was so loud and in your face. Their style was relatable and authentic, and I liked my classmates comment about them looking like they just walked off the street with those outfits on and went to perform. I could totally see that and the way they performed with such skill and ability really goes to show the effort they put into their craft and why they deserved the recognition and fame they got. 

Anyway I am probably going to try writing a bit more of my essay then go to sleep. Might blast some more Zep before bed too. "
"- I am grateful to have a family I can lean on when I have a problem
- I am grateful to live in a place that is safe to go around in while working out
- I am grateful for the variety of food I can eat each week

Today I got a chance to see the car that my dad helped me buy. It was an updated version of my old car that will hopefully be sold asap. I am a bit frustrated that I do not get the SUV like I originally thought, but it taught me something. I have to try and resist telling people everything going on in my life. Especially when something like that is unconfirmed. Not a huge deal, but something to take note of.

Other then that I wrote my film quiz for history and got to relax a bit after that by going for a bike ride in the rain! It was really tough near the last third of my ride when everything was quite soaked, but I pushed through while listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd. The lyrics to Freebird allowed me to push on, more specifically the guitar solo really helped to fly me home. I actually walked basically, but lets not talk about that. 

I had a quick bowl of cereal afterward before pauls class and watched some more statmandave content. That guy really is someone I look up to a lot. He is incredibly intelligent and knows footballs ins and outs. I trust his judgement more than I do the peoples who run my favourite team tbqh. His streams teach me a lot about systems teams use and also the different stats he brings up when making suggestions on who to pick. Alex Telles has created the most chances in the united team while playing less than half the time as the rest of the team in the champions league for example. Ridiculous. 

Other than that today I had some fantastic salmon for dinner, and have now been trying to wrap my head around my philosophy essay. It has been a challenging experience to say the least and I have struggled so much that I went to my sister to see what she thought about the question and my thesis. I am going to try and finish some more of it tonight and then write a conclusion hopefully tomorrow. Ugh maybe I will finish it tomorrow tbh. I don't work now so thats good. Going to wait a bit to see if the cases start to lower before I go back. The extra time to myself will be nice. Tbh I never should have taken the jobs, but hindsight is always 20/20. I need to focus on finding a job where I can work from home. Hopefully something comes up soon. 

Going to finish my night writing and then up early tomorrow to hopefully see liverpool stumble. Here is hoping!"
"- I am grateful for being able to enjoy a calm night watching tv at home
- I am grateful to be able to walk my dog around the block while listening to my favourite music
- I am grateful to be alive in a period where it is almost impossible to be bored

Today I didn't do a ton of stuff. I still however remained quite excited for what I did do. I submitted the awful essay I have been worrying about for my philosophy and I think it will get a good enough grade that I will be happy with. Hopefully above an 80 (fingers crossed). I really think I made a lot of similar point to my sister's outline that she wanted me to rewrite my essay with. I know that it is worthy of a good mark maybe even better than I expect. Theo confirmed it for me and gave me the confidence to submit the thing. Without him I would have definitely have rewritten it, but tbh I am more than fine with simply getting a b+ or even a b in the course overall.

Other than essays I attended classes today, listened to my history of rock playlist and got through the majority of it. I enjoy the journeys through time that music can take you on. I really can see the pictures some of these artists create and thank god for having the music access we have nowadays. I wish more artists had documentaries at the end of the project like all the Beatles ones do because I enjoy hearing about the process and also what the artist thinks about a particular album and the recording process to it. Either way I enjoyed ch 8s 70s era sound and it reminds me of what I would hear on Q104 but with a more psychedelic spin to it.

I also attended my business course and got an extension on my vegan project which I am thankful about because I think I need a bit more time to bs the report and also the video presentation. I now realize it has to be a bit more serious than I originally envisioned and thats fine because I can easily follow the format Andrew had in his 100% video that the prof showed us. I will mimic that and maybe add a few bits of comedy in to spice it up and stand out. Going to use my editing skills once again and honestly another thing I am grateful for is my ability to create with just my old macbook. That was one of the best purchases I have ever made. 

I got to see some exciting football today as well and today was unexpected to say the least. Ending my day with a little football analysis provided by the lads from the Kick Off so I think it was a pretty fantastic Monday. Excited to see what the week brings me. "

"Today is Saturday. Slept in, relaxed in morning so that was nice. Didn't get any practicum work done so I am frustrated about that and now stressing about getting it all done tomorrow (Sunday) in one day along with the cleaning, cooking and calling home. I feel frustrated that I did not plan my day accordingly. Although Cole and I went on a long (3 hour) walk on the dykes to the Grand Pre National Historic Site and we both liked that. But again, poor timing today got in the way and we rushed home as the sun set and had to walk the last 30 minutes in the dark. Today was both relaxing and frustrating. I feel like I have grand plans to be productive on the weekends and somehow time always slips away and I always feel unproductive and like a failure who is incapable of following through with any plans. I always go to bed not feeling good about myself and the choices I made throughout the day."
"Busy day. Productive for the most part. I prioritized cooking, cleaning and practicum assignments over my own physical and mental well being. I procrastinated doing practicum stuff by cooking and cleaning until later in the afternoon. Then practicum stuff took longer than expected which then pushed dinner back and now it is almost 9pm and we are just finishing eating and still want to start a movie. It is Sunday night. I am so frustrated that I always do this. I try to spend my weekends focusing on myself and also being productive but my time management is never there. I always feel rushed Sunday nights and always feel like crap because I feel like I should have accomplished more or finished it sooner or I should have done this or that, etc. I am never happy Sunday nights. I am never happy with my time management. I wanted to read my book, do some yoga, cross more things off my to do list. I think I would feel happier if I also prioritized myself and my well being like I do with practicum assignments. I think I need to start recognizing what I have accomplished and be happy with what I have done. I did lots of work today, just not enough work on myself but the things I did do today were all things that needed to be done. Unfortunately, I just didn't get to my attestation log and now I have to work on my attestation log tomorrow night after practicum to prepare for a Tuesday meeting. Frustrating! I wish I could just be happy with my accomplishments and my time management."
"Hard day today. I was so frustrated with myself and my progress yesterday and I had a hard time falling asleep. I was in lots of pain this morning and got frustrated with NS healthcare. Somewhat productive at practicum today and in the evening with my attestation log. I am frustrated because I had to work on my attestation log all evening because I didn't get to it over the weekend and I have a meeting to prepare for. I feel bad because Cole came to NS to be with me and support me and I feel like because of my poor time management, I haven't been able to return the favour for me. I feel really guilty about that. I need to improve my time management before clinical rotation begins because I know I will be insanely busy at that time and it is not fair to Cole. At least I finished attestation log stuff and I can go to bed feeling better and prepared for tomorrow, but I am still frustrated that it took me all evening to finish it and I had to ignore Cole tonight."
"Today was a better day. Remembrance day today so I had the day off. I spent the time wisely and finally focused on myself. Read a little of my book, went for a 1.5 hour walk with Cole, talked to mom on the phone, did some personal tasks (banking, laundry) and did some practicum assignments. Although I did not finish all the practicum work I wanted to do, I am really happy that I finally prioritized myself today over practicum and got some stuff done that I needed to do and wanted to do for myself. I didn't realize how good it would feel to finally focus on myself for a bit. Hopefully I can remember this feeling and keep on making myself a priority. I really need to do this because I know my time will become more and more precious when clinical starts and I will be busier and busier. But I cannot keep ignoring myself and my needs. Now is the time to learn the value of self love."
Bad day today. Really stressful day at practicum trying to figure out the details about my special meal project and start the finance assignment. Fridays are always busy so Dena was busy herself and we didn't get much done on our calendars for today. I had an awful night last night stressing about my special meal and had a terrible time falling asleep. Cole was very understanding and sweet and he helped me calm down last night. He bought me a bottle of wine to help me relax tonight. I am so grateful for him.
"Got depressing news about my car. Needs expensive fix ups. But I made the potato leek soup at home to try out the recipe and figure out portion sizes and number of servings. Cole and I really like the soup and I am feeling much more confident about my soup now. I hope the taste testing next week goes well. Today is Saturday so it was overall a good, relaxing day. "
Today was a better day at practicum. Productive morning but frustrating afternoon because the laptop I use doesn't always work and it didn't let me save the document I was working on so I had to do it a second time. And then I had to step out of the room which made me lose time to get work done during the day. I felt exhausted and almost fell asleep during a meeting. I need to get more sleep tonight. But today was better than Friday. Finally coming along with some projects but still have many to get through.
"I have noticed that for the last two mornings I have been running out the door late. I really need to stop doing that because it makes for a rushed morning and I feel frazzled when I start the day at practicum. I felt so much better the last two weeks getting to practicum on time (with time to spare) so I need to get back to that routine. And that starts with going to bed earlier and getting a good night sleep so I can wake up feeling refreshed and not going slow in the morning and then running out the door. Not getting enough sleep drains my battery, so does running late. I feel good when I am on time and I think that feeling will help recharge my battery. I had a productive day and a great meeting where we talked about my progress with assignments and attestation log. I am excited for a project I will help with at VRH. Overall good morning but kind of slow in the afternoon. It is 7:45pm and I feel drained. Not enough sleep last night. I didn't drink enough water today so I had a bad headache for the drive home. I don't feel up to doing any homework tonight because I feel so tired. Even more of a reason for me to get into a better sleeping schedule so I can live my days to the fullest and feel like I have enough energy to do what I want during the entire day. I came home to a delicious meal Cole made and it made me very happy."
"Feeling great today. Busy but good day at practicum. Lots of projects on the go and still feeling stressed but trying to focus on the big picture. Practicum is flying by. This week is flying by. The busier I am, the faster the time flies. An idea I heard Q-life coaches say a few days ago resonated with me and I have been thinking about it for the last few days. They said that we should approach each day as a stepping stone to work towards our overall goals in life. Each day is important and we should be aware, alert, and active each day and also enjoy each day as every day is an opportunity. Every morning as I drive to practicum, I think about that. I think about what my day might look like and what I might learn. Even though I feel tired when I first wake up in the mornings, I feel more energized during the day because I am busy and alert. I have also been feeling more grateful for what I have in life (this amazing learning opportunity to be a student learner with the NSHA, a loving and supportive partner who cooks me dinner almost every night and supports me mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically, and my family who also sends their love and support. I am very lucky and very grateful. It is refreshing to be able to realize how lucky I am and express my gratefulness to the people who love me at a time when I am so busy and stressed. Cole got mad at me in the shower and when I came out of the bathroom, he put away my clothes and laid out my pajamas for me and gave me a big hug. I love him."
"Today was a great day. Productive and I used my brain a lot so my brain felt like mush at the end of the day. But I got lots of work done and I am proud of the work I accomplished today. I feel like I fit in with the staff at SMH and I feel more and more comfortable and confident in practicum each day at SMH. I only have one more week with Dena doing admin at SMH and I am already sad about leaving. I have really enjoyed my time at SMH in level 2, way more than I expected I would. I feel like I am getting so much more out of it than I did last summer. I wish my experience was this positive last summer in level 1. I had a taste testing of my special meal soup and I was nervous but now I don't know why I was nervous because it went great. The staff was really nice and helped me prepare, they tasted it and gave me great feedback. I don't mind the long drive and the long days, staying late and lots of work because I am getting so much out of it. I truly feel like I am working towards my vision and I lived my purpose today. I still have to consider my values, but each day at practicum when I work hard and learn new things, I am working towards my purpose and my vision. I am so proud of myself. I feel great. It is Friday and usually I feel worn out but I feel fueled and ready to go."
"Haven't journaled in a bit. Crazy week. Finished admin rotation at Soldiers Memorial Hospital. 2 more weeks of admin at Valley Regional Hospital and then I start clinical. Special meal day was last Thursday and it went great. I had my IUD appointment last Tuesday. I have more appointments coming up next week which I am a bit nervous about. Cole and I haven't been getting along great lately. I am trying to focus on myself while he is at work. I try to be productive around the apartment but also mentally. I cleaned today, talked to parents and grandparents, texted Meaghan, video chatted with a friend last night, am about to take a hot bath and read a book. Trying to put myself first and do what I want to do when I have the time. I know I will be very busy when clinical begins so I need to learn to put myself first and be in a good head space and a better space with Cole before I won't have the time to work on myself and our relationship. Today was a good day. I figured out what values are important to me. I think I figured out my vision. And I can see how my values will help steer me to my vision. I still have to work on my purpose, but that is ok. This is hard work."
"Today is Sunday. Slept in which was nice. Got some stuff done that I wanted to. But as always, I put practicum stuff on the back burner. Cole worked a morning shift and is now on the way home. I've been telling myself all week that I should enjoy Sunday night and relax with Cole when he comes home rather than stressing and trying to finish all the stuff I didn't get done during the day when he was at work. I will try my best to follow through with this plan because I know it will be beneficial for myself, for him, and for us. He misses me when I am at practicum, I miss him when he is at work, we are already struggling to balance our different schedules and we need to learn to put things aside to enjoy the time we have together whenever the opportunity arises."
"Today is Sunday. One more week of admin rotation. Feeling a little stressed and trying to work on some practicum stuff so I won't be super stressed this week. But I just finished the section on stress and I know that some stress is beneficial as it helps us reach our optimum performance. I am also trying to control my day and my emotions, break up the work with activities I enjoy such as reading and going for a walk. Cole will be home in a few hours from work and I want to enjoy the rest of the evening with him so I will get as much work done as I can now before he comes home. Overall feeling great."
"It has been a while since I last journaled and completed any Q-life stuff. Too bad because I was on a roll and was feeling great about my progress and started feeling the effects. I am currently on day 5 of recovery after surgery. I am now off of percocet and feeling better, although still in pain. But I am finding that now I am no longer taking percocet, I am more mentally awake and aware of reality. Although being awake and aware is nice, I am also really bored now. My mobility is still really limited so I can't do much physically other than walk from the bedroom to the kitchen. I haven't been outside and had fresh air in 5 days. I haven't showered in 6 days. I feel lazy and bored and eager to start practicum clinical assignments. I think I really should take another few days and relax and enjoy this extra time off of practicum because I know once I resume, I will be really busy and wishing I had this time at home to relax. I should also try to be grateful for my recovery, my health, and this relaxation time. I have so many things to be grateful for and I should start to realize and appreciate it. There are many things I can be doing around the apartment to keep me occupied and happy rather than wasting time watching tv. I should make more of an effort to engage in some other stimulating activities tomorrow. I think that will help me feel better."
"On day 6 of recovering from surgery. Minimal mobility is really taking a toll on me. I wish I could move around and get more physical activity. I think I would also benefit from napping and I should really try to nap more often while I still can during this recovery period. I am getting tired of feeling lazy. Although I still dread going back to crazy practicum schedules, I look forward to having more to do in my life and feeling productive. "
"Still recovering from surgery. Little more mobile now. Had a scare yesterday and went to the ER late last night but all is well. Feeling tired and didn't nap today because I didn't prioritize napping. But I was productive today, getting some stuff done off of my to do list and it feels great. I hope I will continue to be productive this week and next as I transition into doing practicum assignments, while also relaxing and spending some time quality time with Cole over the holidays."
"it is a nice day. although i did not lots of homework, i take a break for myself. i chat with my best friend to share our life. we make a plan for next summer holiday when i back to China we can hang out together. i look forward to traveling with her. "

"although my test all finished, i have a habit to think about my test questions such as this question answer should be this nit that. i caudated my test mark through my remember. and i alway regard to write a wrong answer.

"Today was a hard day, I struggled to find motivation to do my work and decided to nap instead. "
"today I had a meeting with a prof and discussed some ways I could improve my work, which was really helpful and gave me a boost of confidence! I also treated myself to getting my hair done and baking."
"Today has been a good day, relaxing and I did well on my midterm this morning, it   still could be better thought because im feeling stressed for deadlines"
"today was another day, I spent it   in classes and working on assignments, I may head home tonight to have a break away from school "
"I cam home yesterday to have a break from the school environment and I am feeling good, ive almost completed a lab that is due this evening and also got to have one of my friends from home to hangout and do work together! today has been a good day so far "
today was a good day at home with Sarah and then then evening with dev and his sister and boyfriend shopping 
Time to start finishing up everything in my classes for finals 
This week is going to be hard but I will get through it   and finish everything I need to get finished!!
Im very stressed and frustrated today because I had made a list for the past two days and haven't been able to complete everything because everything is taking me longer then it should be. 
I am finally finished my exams but I won't feel rested until I get all my marks back! 
I was able to start and finish 2 large assignments today but was not very active or healthy in my food choices 
I felt irritated today
Finished some school work
I haven't left my house for more than a few minutes in weeks because I have so much work to do for school. I wake up and sit in my house all day doing school work until it is time to go to sleep.
pretty good. didn't work out today so that was not good but still felt good about the day.  
"Today has been a good day. I had a psychology midterm that went okay, looking forward to finishing a few assignments for physiology and then starting my chemistry assignment."
Tomorrow is my chemistry midterm and Iâ€™m freaking out.
"I am very stressed out about the pandemic, and I have my chemistry midterm tonight and I am freaking out. "
I am currently isolating for COVID at the moment and my test is on Sunday. I did better on my chemistry midterm than I had initially thought. In classes today and I have a few meetings. 
"I feel pretty good today apart from being quarantined in my house. I miss being more physically active, going outside, and seeing my friends/family. But I have been productive today, cleaned my house and am hanging out. "
I feel okay still a bit down because I am still isolating and cannot exercise. 
Today I tested negative for COVID! I can FINALLY leave the house and gain some social interactions! YAY! School is ramping up though and it is making me feel not as in control. WIth classes like chemistry it is hard to think I will do well because I feel so lost and exercise physiology is the next day which I need to do well. 
My day is good!!!
"My day is starting off good, trying to finish off a few assignments/papers "
Good day trying to be productive - Chem help tonight.
"It is a good day so far, a little stressed about exams season and my midterm today but it is also my grandparents wedding anniversary and I am excited to celebrate with them!"
"Today I did online school all day. I had a midterm, which went okay I think. I went to a walk around the block with my dad. I made breakfast, which doesn't always happen. I drank lots of water and gave myself some down time to recharge. "
"great day 
"
:)
"I woke up early, went to the gym, completed notes, went shopping and out to lunch with my mom"
"slept in very late. Talking to dayja about coming home is great but I can't feel extremely happy like she is because i'm too stressed on the variables im waiting on, like waiting for queens and moving and finding a job and covid. "
"I struggled to wake up today, just didn't have the motivation to do anything. I managed to get a bit of work done for my labs and get ahead on other things. Then with Dayja I love her but I she is getting very needy and clingy. I know this is just because she misses me but Its getting to be a lot. "
did pretty well on my mid term. Came across and emulator for old games I used to play when i was young and I want to really look into it when I have the time.
"Last night I was really stressing over getting into queens. The coach has been taking a long time to respond. However, today I've decided I have to message him as I can wait no longer. I have also found someone that will be a great option to take my room for the rest of the winter term and pay the 400 for my stuff in the room."
Beer with prof matt was so much fun. I finally found someone to take my room for second term as well. and after all the stress from queens i finally got an answer from them saying we are waiting for admissions. I also can't work for byrdon until the spring. I also am still on edge with josh and him and dayja talking tonight. I can't get a break from the stress
After great  night out last night. I came home to see that my roomates are not wanting the guy I have to0 take over the room to take on the sublet. I am done with being nice and doing what they want. I have done my deed and got someone to take on my portion of the rent. Therefore if they are not happy then they can pay for my portion of the rent.
"Manny threw me a surprise party!!! I was never so happy to be surprised. It was everything I wanted the whole night I was smiling. I literally had tears of joy the whole time. Also I have found people to take my room, I'm just waiting for them to respond."
finally moved out of Nova scotia. I found a person to take the room and we are finalizing the paper work. It's good to be back home in ontario and with my girlfriend again.
Last night I caught dayja going into my phone and that she has not trusted me in the relationship for the past 3 months I've been away. I dont know what to feel yet. I am mad but I am just disappointed too. I don't know how to go forward yet. I need to work out first to clear my head
"Today I woke up and had my coffee and some water. Then I worked on my take home midterm and had breakfast. I then attended meetings and classes, had lunch, worked on homework and then worked out."
"Started my day by grabbing some fruit and water, then headed out for a 3k walk. I worked on some homework for the entire day and then plan to relax and watch a movie tonight."
Went out for breakfast today and applied for graduate programs. 
I spent the day applying for graduate programs and I took time for myself by cooking a dinner I enjoy.
Today is a very busy day with lots of little things to complete and do. Stress is starting to pile up!
"I woke up this morning with low energy even though I got about 7 hours of sleep last night. That was not a good start to my day, but I wanted to work out so I pushed myself and got that done. Then I attended classes for the rest of the day and did homework!"
Today was a rough day. 
A lot going on in my life lately. It is difficult to juggle school and emotions.
"Today has been rough, once again."
"That past few days have been rough but I am feeling a lot better today. I miss my dog dearly, who died two days ago but that is part of life. Ready to continue my day."
Very tired and low energy today
A much better and productive day.
"Again, I was much more productive today which makes me really happy."
"Feeling increasingly accomplished today again, I am happy about that!"
Did not get a great sleep last night which caused me to have a not so great day.
Mildly productive day! Proud of myself for pushing through at the night.
Good day today!
"Working on some stuff today, but stressed!"
Busy day yesterday and today. Moving back to NB today and lots of things are hectic with school. Stressed.
"Started studying for exams. Not excited about that, but I am feeling motivated!"
Another day spent studying for exams. 
Studying is going well. Glad I took time to exercise as a study break.
"Spent time studying, starting to get a bit burnt out which is not good. Worked out again though."
Just feeling down and flat. Exam season always does this.
"I find myself dreading the start to each day because I know I have to study everyday, but now after almost completing this program I am able to find relaxation times and reflect better on my days. I am more confident in my abilities. "
Feeling better about how to practice resilience during stressful situations. I am able to remain positive and have self-efficacy! 
I coached myself through that exam with the help of Q life! I took some of the things I learned and put them to use.
My day was busy!! I had a midterm at 8:30. then had breakfast and had strength and conditioning at 11-12 and again at 3-4. in between I went for a lovely walk. for the rest of the night I am going to finish some assignments 
Today is my busiest day. I have yet to get a break to do school work !! But am thankful to be able to do all of the things im able to do 
I had a French midterm that was a bit hard! but I went to the gym after and it felt good! I ate yummy food and accomplished a lot assignments
"Hungover all day, fought with my girlfriend and didnâ€™t get much school work done"
Solid day of physical activity and school work
Felt great on the ice today. Got alot of work done and was an overall successful day!
Boring day
Busy day and even busier weekend
Great day started with a great morning. I did nap but still got my stuff done
Study day
 
"I woke up, went for a morning walk. Had a team workout and practice. And spent the whole day with the girl friend friend walking around down town Wolfville. Made a nice supper and watched a movie before heading to bed."
Was a good start to a Monday. I had a great sleep had a practice and a workout this morning and managed to get a lot of work done.
Having been very disciplined organizing my physical active life along with getting good quality of homework done.
